# TEXT Open Intent Recognition (TEXTOIR)

TEXTOIR is the first high-quality Text Open Intent Recognition platform. This repo contains a convenient toolkit with extensible interfaces, integrating a series of state-of-the-art algorithms of two tasks (open intent detection and open intent discovery). We also release the pipeline framework and the visualized platform in the repo [TEXTOIR-DEMO](https://github.com/thuiar/TEXTOIR-DEMO). 


## Introduction
TEXTOIR aims to provide a convenience toolkit for researchers to reproduce the related text open classification and clustering methods. It contains two tasks, which are defined as open intent detection and open intent discovery. Open intent detection aims to identify n-class known intents, and detect one-class open intent. Open intent discovery aims to leverage limited prior knowledge of known intents to find fine-grained known and open intent-wise clusters. Related papers and codes are collected in our previous released [reading list](https://github.com/thuiar/OKD-Reading-List).

## Quick Start
1. Use anaconda to create Python (version >= 3.6) environment
```
conda create --name textoir python=3.6
conda activate textoir
```

2. Install PyTorch (Cuda version 11.2)

```
git clone git@github.com:thuiar/TEXTOIR.git
cd TEXTOIR
cd open_intent_detection
```
4. Install related environmental dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run examples (Take ADB as an example)
```
sh examples/run_ADB.sh
```

* Note that if you cannot download the pre-trained model directly from HuggingFace transformers, you need to download it yourself. We provide the pre-trained bert model in the following link:  
[Baidu Cloud Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1k1zxK4xh0UyPhOU_-oPlow) with code: v8tk

## Extensibility

This toolkit is extensible and supports adding new methods, datasets, configurations, backbones, dataloaders, losses conveniently. More detailed information can be seen in the tutorials of the directories [open_intent_detection](./open_intent_detection/README.md) and [open_intent_discovery](./open_intent_discovery/README.md). 

<!-- ### Extensibility

### Reliability
The codes in this repo have been confirmed and are reliable. 

The experimental results are close to the reported ones in our AAAI 2021 papers [Discovering New Intents with DeepAligned Clustering](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17689) and [Deep Open Intent Classification with Adaptive Decision Boundary](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17690). Note that the results of some methods may fluctuate in a small range due to the selected random seeds, hyper-parameters, optimizers, etc. The final results are the average of 10 random seeds to reduce the influence of different selected known classes. -->
