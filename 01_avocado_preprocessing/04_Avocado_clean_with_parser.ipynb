We look to Benamex as a potential \"anchor\" account for our banking industry initiative. Goodwill and great reference from anchor accounts are vital to our strategy for success. Our existing customers such as ETrade and Alaska Airlines have nothing but great things to say about our level of commitment to them. We want to add Benamex to this list as well. Winning this account is even more crucial because of our connection to HP. We hope our success here will provide a model for how to work together to crack big accounts.  I am excited about this opportunity and am happy to offer whatever help I can provide in moving the sales process forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVenktesh Shukla\\r\\nChief Executive Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nAvocadoIT, Inc.\\r\\n2211 No. First Street, Ste. 200\\r\\nSan Jose, CA  95131\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect:   (408) 562-8010\\r\\nPager:   (888) 763-0797\\r\\nFax:      (408) 562-8108\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-----Original Message-----\\r\\nFrom: DEPERALTA,AIREEN (HP-Cupertino,ex1)\\r\\n[mailto:aireen_deperalta@hp.com]\\r\\nSent: Wednesday, April 11, 2001 1:51 PM\\r\\nTo: \\'venk.shukla@avocadoit.com\\'; ARENAS,MARTHA (HP-Mexico,ex1);\\r\\nSPATARO,NICCOLO (HP-Mexico,ex1)\\r\\nCc: KOMORI,ZENKI (HP-Mexico,ex1); ZAMORA,EDUARDO (HP-Mexico,ex1);\\r\\n\\'fortunata hermoso\\'; WATSON,JULIE (HP-Cupertino,ex1); GRATTON,RANDOLPH\\r\\n(HP-UK,unix1)\\r\\nSubject: AvocadoIT\\'s CEO committed to winning Banamex deal\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHola, Martha and Niccolo,\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to introduce you to Venk Shukla, CEO of AvocadoIT, one of the\\r\\nE-services Partner Division\\'s (ESPD) mobile partners. We are currently\\r\\nworking with them on creating a qualified worldwide funnel and closing some\\r\\ndeals. I am their Sales Engagement manager incented to making this happen,\\r\\nand I have been in touch with Eduardo and Zenki to provide help in moving\\r\\nthe process along.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenk is making himself available to help win the deal at Banamex against\\r\\nEdify/Unisys. He\\'s aware that Unisys is the incumbent since they implemented\\r\\nBanamex\\'s internet banking solution and may have an advantage. Please feel\\r\\nfree to pull him in when talking to the executives at Banamex so that we can\\r\\nprovide a unified team. His number is 408-562-8010,\\r\\nVenk.Shukla@avocadoit.com.

Banamex is one\\r\\nof our \"Must Win\" accounts, so you can be sure that all levels of HP\\r\\nmanagement are going to get involved to win this one. Marta is the GM of\\r\\nFinancial Services and Nicolo is the GM of HPC in Mexico. They will be\\r\\nmeeting with one of the Banamex directors next week. HP Mexico has a good\\r\\nrelationship with Banamex, who is one of our top customers, so this should\\r\\nhelp us in the decision-making.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for offering your services and showing your commitment to close\\r\\nBanamex.
