      "'Hi willy,\\n\\nSince the menu resides on the client side, that leaves little alternative\\nin the design of interactive menus for html pages.\\n\\nWhile I build dynamic menus in several different manners, the method which\\ncomes closest to what you want is a merging of JSP and a DHTML menu\\nsimiliar to what you see on our www.jspinsider.com site.\\n\\nWhat we do on some projects is drive the actual menu element design from a\\ndatabase. When the user logs on, we build up a unique version of the menu\\nelements relative to their security and access rights. Then store the\\nresults in the session object. Then when a JSP page is called, a DHTML menu\\nstructure is built relative to the data in the session object.\\nAt that point everything is back in dhtml and javascript.\\n\\nCasey Kochmer\\nPresident Amberjack Software LLC\\n\\n>From: Willy LEGIMAN <Willy.LEGIMAN@FINEMORES.COM.AU>\\n>Reply-To: A mailing list about Java Server Pages specification and\\n>     reference <JSP-INTEREST@java.sun.com>'\n",
