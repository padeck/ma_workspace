      "Verizon Wireless to Co-Market Accenture Mobile Service Bureau\n",
      "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 28, 2002-- Accenture (NYSE: ACN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=acn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/a/acn.html>) announces the launch of the Accenture Mobile Service Bureau - a new corporate wireless data service that will enable business customers to access applications, corporate information, Internet, intranet and e-mail/Personal Information Manager (PIM) from mobile devices. \n",
      "The Accenture Mobile Service Bureau provides an integrated hosted solution, including: enterprise-grade security, coordinated logistics and provisioning for distribution of devices, application management, device management, software distribution, and wireless network integration. Because the Mobile Service Bureau is a fully hosted solution that combines customer care, service billing and device management, it will help companies avoid the complexities involved in integrating equipment behind an enterprise firewall. \n",
      "``Mobile data is expected to be a significant catalyst of process change for many core business functions, driving down costs and improving customer service,'' said Fred M. Fosnacht, partner in Accenture's Communications & High Tech global market unit. ``Accenture intends to help companies reduce the risk and manage total cost of ownership by offering an end-to-end mobile solutions environment to support mobile application deployment.'' \n",
      "In conjunction with the introduction of Accenture's Mobile Service Bureau, Accenture also announced an alliance with Verizon Wireless to jointly market this new capability in the United States. The two companies will jointly offer a range of mobile solutions and services through the Accenture Mobile Service Bureau. These include mobile corporate email/PIM; mobile intranet access; mobile data access; and mobile sales force and mobile field service, both of which are designed to enable employees in the field to respond more quickly to customers. \n",
      "The Accenture Mobile Service Bureau will jointly be offered with Verizon Wireless' recently introduced Express Network, Verizon Wireless' 1xRTT data network, which is capable of speeds up to 144 kbps, as well as Verizon Wireless' existing coast-to-coast digital network. The combined offering is expected to provide enterprises with one of the first pre-integrated end-to-end services for mobile application delivery. By ensuring rapid user configuration and quick deployment, the joint offering could also help companies achieve a rapid return on investment -- one of the many challenges they face in providing an efficient and productive wireless platform to their employees on the road. \n",
      "Wireless Enterprise Market Background \n",
      "Companies are increasingly using today's mobile enterprise solutions to allow their sales forces and field technicians to send and retrieve data in real-time and to give employees anytime, anywhere access corporate information. By mobilizing underlying business processes, companies can cut down on report production time; respond more accurately to customers; provide better data to employees, customers and partners; and complete invoicing and billing procedures with greater speed and precision. \n",
      "Despite the downturn in technology markets, forecasters predict that mobility in the enterprise will be a significant market during the next four years. IDC predicts that, by 2005, the US market for mobile enterprise data services (including service implementation and management, support and operations) will reach approximately $16 billion\n",

      "As you are aware, EP replied to an Genuity/Verizon RFI on content transformation for Verizon.  My contact, Ken Okaya, Director of New Technologies, was apart of that evaluation team.  The net result of the search is that EP was short listed with Aether and Brience, but nothing came out of the search.  Specifically, Verizon could not find sincere interest in their customer base to move forward.  Similarly, Genuity could not find sincere interest in their customer base to mobilize Black Rocket, which was a piece of the Genuity search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Ken stated that he was looking for a way to fit a trial version of a mobile platform within Genuity.  This would serve two purposes:  1) get Genuity comfortable with a vendors ability and 2) allow them to poll their customer base for interest based on a pilot performance.  Ken stated that they have a successful implementation of Siebel CRM in place for customer support and sales.  He thought that this may be a good test case to mobilize in a pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next steps we discussed were to get ball park pricing to Ken on what he could expect for a pilot.  He would then float this to senior management for go forward.\n",

      "Our customers include leading Telecommunications companies such as AT&T, BellSouth, Telus, Bell Canada, SaskTel and others in the industry.

When these qualified visitors are on the site, your company and products are \"Top of Mind\" -- creating a unique opportunity to engage with prospects in a real-time sales discussion and move them forward in the customer acquisition process -- before they leave to visit Aether Systems, and then go to AvantGo.\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter and I had a very productive day at Biogen today.  We met with our Director level Biogen sponsor, and her team, along with the senior Accenture partner and  his team.  Their CIO canceled at the last minute.   The Biogen team seemed reasonably self conscious about the change in his schedule.  We were on site for just under four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm happy to say we believe we were able to achieve our objectives of convincing Biogen to give us the whole project,  and gain some agreement on price, terms, and timing.  We're not done yet, but could be as early as next week.  Congrats to Peter, and thanks to all for their work to date....\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this note is to summarize the business terms we will be proposing tomorrow.  Peter, please capture these on EPTH letterhead and deliver to Leslie by mid day tomorrow via letter format with a copy to Matt, Prakash, Richard and myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the tentative agreement is  book a 400 seat transaction with 100K in services, plus expenses.  We will invoice and recognize 90K in licenses immediately.  The initial maintenance term is 15 months. The balance of the licenses will remain a booking to be shipped the earlier of Biogen's request, or June 30th, assuming we meet our commitments for code drops.  Services deliverables will be billed net 30 days from the drop dates.  We will also deliver a Volume Purchase Agreement that will ensure Biogen's ability to buy at aggressive prices as they increase their commitment to AvocadoIT.  This offer would expire January 24th.  (Prakash, does this give us the runway for the 2/14 deliverable?)\n",
      "\n",
      "In exchange for capping the Notes professional services work at $100K, we have been able to increase/double the size of the software order.  Payment terms on services will be net 30 days from code drop dates.  Effectively, we will deliver the services at just over cost, and capture the margin on the back end via a product order.  This will hurt our product margins, but in the end should allow us to capture our first customer and deliver the project at break even or better.\n",
      "\n",
      "In bulleted format our proposal is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "*\tBiogen will place an order for 400 licenses  the discount level will be the same as the original proposal\n",
      "*\tThe first 200 licenses will be invoiced net 30 days.  Standard warranty applies.\n",
      "*\tThe balance of the licenses will be shipped the earlier of Biogen's request or June 30th.  Payment terms for that order will be 120 days.\n",
      "*\tThe initial maintenance term will be 15 months.\n",
      "*\tProfessional services will be capped at $100K, Biogen will pay the actual travel expenses for EPTH staff.  EPTH agrees to abide by Biogen travel policy, and work to control expense.\n",
      "*\tBiogen will have the right to a free upgrade to a Lotus Notes connector product  when commercially available.\n",
      "*\tMaintenance increases will be capped at (Peter, what had we discussed last week?)\n",
      "*\tBiogen will be eligible for a \"first customer ship discount\" of 40% over the next 12 months if they take one of the first two product deliveries of new EPTH products\n",
      "\n",
      "Kimberlie, from a construction perspective we'll need to clean up our license to look more like a products company, and less like an ASP.  One initial step is to take Studio out of the agreement, and put it on the Schedule A with the balance of the products.  Thanks in advance for your help there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like our VPA (Volume Purchase Agreement) to propose the following step level discounts.  The agreement is dollar volume based, and product independent.  The term is 24 months from the initial license date.  Past the initial order:\n",
      "\n",
      "*\t0-500K       25%\n",
      "*\t500K-1M    35%\n",

      "*\t1.5-2M      45%\n",
      "*\t2M >         50%\n",
      "\n",
      "These discounts are aggressive considering the initial purchase, but we're not in a position with a lot of leverage at this point.  On the other hand, we should hold firm and fight aggressively to stay within these bounds.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We're close to getting our first customer, but have a stressful week of contract negotiation to complete.   I am available via cell over the balance of the week, and over the weekend.\n",

      "1.  Regarding Siebel, from a product perspective, AvocadoIT solves the offline and PocketPC pieces of the puzzle that Siebel Wireless does not have.  The current version of Siebel Wireless can only do WML to phones in an online mode. Problems abound from ineffective form factor, poor coverage issues, no flexibility of devices, etc.  Siebel conducted an extensive search for a partner to provide a solution and selected AvocadoIT.  The offline mode of interaction is one of the three we support - the others being online, interactive searching and intelligent alerts.  Please see the advance copy of this data sheet.\n",

      "2. From our discussion, it sounds like there may be a short-term need to have the order tracking extranet site rendered in the iMode protocol for the 300 or so P&G sponsoring stores in Japan.  Since we have a partnership with NTT DoCoMo (and its SI arm, NTT East), AvocadoIT supports this critical protocol.  \n",

      "\n",
      "3. As we discussed, the benefit to AvocadoIT for participating in the gratis evaluation with Anyware is potential recommendation to the appropriate business units undertaking wireless projects.  In order to maximize your evaluation, we are prepared and anxious to help with technical support and product knowledge.  Please feel free to leverage Ray Canuel in order to facilitate this.  Candid feedback and status updates would allow us to better gauge the evaluation and learn from this experience in advance of potential revenue opportunities.  \n",

We discussed the professional services payment (single payment) being payable upon successful completion of the project , and upfront payment of licenses only (protection for Biogen in the delivery since we are assuming risk on the licenses).  My understanding is that the total $100K payment for professional services is payable upon acceptance of the final SOW. \n",

      "To interface the Offline Server Agent (OSA) with the Siebel server, 3 choices are available:\n",
      " \n",
      "- Java Data Bean - enables external applications to access Siebel objects without having to display the Siebel user interface. The Java Data Bean provides functional access to the Siebel applications for both reading and writing data. \n",

      "- CORBA - enable external applications to access Siebel business objects through CORBA using Inprise's Visibroker or Iona's Orbix ORB\n",

      "- XML via Siebel EAI - a development environment/framework for building integration between Siebel applications and external applications and technologies\n",
      "The Java Data Bean was chosen for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unlike CORBA, object interfaces can support multiple users on the same machine. This allows one program to concurrently access data for several users via the Java login method.\n",
      "\n",
      "- OSA and the adaptors are written in Java, and it is much easier to interface it with other Java objects\n",
      "\n",
      "- CORBA is notoriously difficult to work with and debug. It also has no versioning support and is thus very brittle.\n",
      "\n",
      "- the EAI interface was designed for large scale transfer of data between peer applications, and there is a significant learning curve for us to master it\n",
      "\n",
      "- Java provides us with much more flexibility to interface to other CRM products in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "- Our architecture approach will be to build a Java base OSA adapter class for generic CRM from which we can subclass Siebel and other CRM products in the future. In other words, our generic objects such as Account and Contact will be represented as XML structures, which the adapter will translate at run-time to access the appropriate CRM product.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Java is much more familiar to our developers, and productivity gains are well documented in the literature\n",

      "SAP's total revenue for 1Q02 was up 9% to EUR 1.658B, while license revenue dropped 12% from the same quarter last year to EUR 402M. Despite the overall revenue growth, SAP reported a 40% drop in net income for the quarter. The continued tightening of IT budgets, especially in the United States and Japan, contributed to the disappointing results. License revenue from the United States, for example, was down 28%, and license revenue from Japan was down 56%. In terms of SAP products, posting the steepest declines were, predictably, the newer mySAP initiatives, including mySAP SCM (with a decline of 23%), mySAP PLM (with a decline of 28%), and mySAP Portals and Exchanges (with a decline of 45%).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A core requirement of many manufacturers is to integrate configurations directly into the ordering workflows.  Blue Martini's acqusition of Cybrant is what's needed to get sales of Manufacturing kick-started. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eighteen months into launching Manufacturing, Blue Martini is finding itself with its back against the wall.  The quick acqusition of Cybrant moves Blue Martini closer to competitive parity on paper and buys the sell-side vendor time in the turbulent order management market.  Choosing wisely to first integrate Cybrant's Pricing Configurator into Manufacturing, Blue Martini is tackling the toughest configuration challenge many manufacturers need help with-managing their pricing for profits. \n",
      "\n",
      "The addition of Cybrant's strong configuration functionality, advanced architecture, and deep domain expertise is a win for Blue Martini, especially in an all stock deal valued at a little over $7M.  However, nothing short of a full product re-launch of Manufacturing, integrated with Cybrant's applications, is needed for Blue Martini to gain the momentum it needs to succeed with this suite.  A large part of the focus needed is the development of two to three lighthouse accounts that can show Manufacturing delivers results.  Finally, Blue Martini needs to deliver a roadmap showing full integration of all Cybrant products.  Taken together, these steps will firmly establish Manufacturing in targeted markets.\n",

      "Commerce One's Endurance Is Flagging and Needs SAP for a Bailout \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In Commerce One's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, the company announced $31.8M in revenue for 1Q02, operating expenses of $88.1M, and a pro forma net loss of $55.0M.  This quarter is the fifth in a row reflecting revenue of $20M less than the previous quarter, and it puts the survival of Commerce One into serious question.  Although the firm is laying off 30% of its 1600 employees to keep its cash burn rate down, the issue becomes more fundamental--one of strategy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Users have been timid about adopting the company's current 5.0 e-procurement and e-sourcing products, as they are competitively weak in their respective crowded markets.  In response, Commerce One execs are now laying the foundation to reposition the company as a Business Process Management (BPM) and a Web services vendor.  As much as AMR Research has always applauded Commerce One's standards-based, componentized architecture, these new forays into BPM and Web services are not big-dollar propositions, and they further cloud Commerce One's value proposition.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Cash-cow SAP has proven that it can be the cause of, and the solution to, all of Commerce One's problems.  The Enterprise Buyer relationship between Commerce One and SAP ended in January, which has thrown into question what will happen to Commerce One and what will happen to its users.  While the company is in a good cash position with $250M in the bank, it cannot continue down its stormy path without an umbrella.  It is our recommendation that SAP solve a problem that it helped to create by buying Commerce One so that users can take the best from both worlds: strong enterprise application functionality from SAP, and BPM, integration, content management, and Web services from Commerce One.  \n",

      "\n",
      "In our \"Doing Business with Government\" series, we talk a lot about\n",
      "the importance of advanced knowledge -- KNOWING about an agency, its \n",
      "people, its nuances and, most importantly, its program goals.  You \n",
      "have to understand the needs of your potential customer BEFORE you can \n",
      "begin to sell effectively to that customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You identify your target agencies by studying such information as \n",
      "budgets, procurement forecasts and acquisition plans.  Once identified, \n",
      "you get to know the decision-makers within those agencies.  By following\n",
      "these steps effectively, you begin to \"fuel\" your sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this third  installment of our IT series, we're going to talk in some \n",
      "depth about a position that has come to be known as \"Business Development,\" \n",
      "one that is responsible for fueling sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "* WHAT IS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT? *\n",
      "\n",
      "A business development position is essentially a sales position.  The \n",
      "important distinction is that the business developer is involved in long \n",
      "term activity, while the salesperson is involved in short term activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Business development folks shape potential requirements into \"actionable\"\n",
      "or \"ripe\" sales opportunities.  Their horizon is half a year to two years\n",
      "down the road.  Their focus is on building knowledge and relationships \n",
      "within agencies to shape programs, budgets and requirements in the\n",
      "company's favor.     \n",
      "\n",
      "A salesperson's horizon shouldn't go out beyond one year.  A salesperson \n",
      "must focus on what can be closed THIS quarter, while setting up deals for \n",
      "the next one or two quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"INSIDE\" VS. \"OUTSIDE\" BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT *\n",
      "\n",
      "Our friends at immixGroup like to make the distinction between inside and \n",
      "outside business development.  A business development person on the inside \n",
      "is doing research and feeding information to an outside business development \n",
      "person who is doing the relationship-building.  In smaller organizations, a \n",
      "business developer generally will perform both of these functions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a closer look:\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside business development person (BD) conducts research to find \n",
      "target agencies, official buyers, and end-users who are interested in \n",
      "buying the company's products or services.\n",
      "\n",
      "One simple example of this: an inside BD will find a target agency and \n",
      "provide the sales staff with a list of people who have bought the company's \n",
      "products or services in the past, or are intending to buy them in the \n",
      "future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In organizations that sell complex products or services, where the sales \n",
      "cycle is long, the inside BD is probably feeding this information to the \n",
      "outside BD, who grabs the baton, if you will, and begins the relationship-\n",
      "building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside\n",
      "\n",
      "While inside BD is identifying and tracking opportunities well in advance \n",
      "of an RFP, the outside BD is taking an active role in the communication \n",
      "necessary to respond to such things as requests for information and market \n",
      "surveys.  The outside BD is working to shape acquisition plans, define future \n",
      "requirements and influence evaluation criteria.  \n",
      "\n",
      "More broadly stated, the outside BD is working toward building public/private \n",
      "partnerships, taking an active role in decision-making events, such as budget \n",
      "planning and legislative committee meetings, to help shape future technology\n",
      "programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "* SHAPING DECISIONS, FUELING SALES *\n",
      "\n",
      "Business developers help fuel sales.  Or, to use another analogy, they're \n",
      "like the wide end of a funnel.  They perform the necessary functions to \n",
      "increase the company's sales opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simple \"success story\" example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say you know the chief technology officer at your state's Department \n",
      "of Transportation, a guy named Bob.  Let's also say that you (who perform \n",
      "both inside and outside BD for a Sun Microsystems reseller) first found out \n",
      "about Bob by reviewing the state's DOT acquisition plan.  Thereafter, you \n",
      "made phone calls and paid personal visits.  You now have Bob's ear.  \n",
      "Fortunately, he seems to respect your opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob is planning to build a new statewide network for sharing highway \n",
      "construction information among the state's various DOT offices.  The \n",
      "procurement is at least a year-and-a-half away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob doesn't want to screw up.  His very job depends on the success of this \n",
      "project.  At this stage, he doesn't even know whether this new network will \n",
      "be built on a Unix or Microsoft OS platform.  He's looking for information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because your company sells Unix-based computers, you need to spend every \n",
      "opportunity you have preaching the virtues of Unix.  You attend meetings, \n",
      "meet Bob for lunch, write and send him white papers, etc. -- not necessarily\n",
      "schmoozing per se, but being helpful, providing relevant information, helping \n",
      "Bob do his job.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Bob has an important decision to make, and he's going to listen to both \n",
      "sides, the Unix side and the Microsoft side.  Like an attorney before a \n",
      "judge, you have to be the advocate for your side and do it well.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Bob makes the decision to go with Unix.  When the RFP comes out, the \n",
      "specifications will call for Unix hardware.  NOW your company has a real sales\n",
      "opportunity.  But without good business development, it might not have happened.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Job well done.  You can pat yourself on the back.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* HIRING THE RIGHT PEOPLE *\n",
      "\n",
      "Larger companies will often hire \"insiders,\" folks who used to work in \n",
      "government or have well-established relationships with decision-makers in \n",
      "government.  This of course is why, for example, former DOD officials sometimes \n",
      "end up working for major defense contractors.  These companies know full-well \n",
      "the importance of relationships and business development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not every company is large enough to hire sales people AND business \n",
      "development people, and certainly not large enough to hire big insiders.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Small compaies, however, operating within the government IT sector \n",
      "should think about hiring people with business development mindsets.  You \n",
      "want sales people (through hiring or training) that think not only short \n",
      "term but long term, sales people that look down the road beyond their next \n",
      "paycheck.  (If you're lucky, you'll even have technical people with business \n",
      "development mindsets.)\n",
      "\n",
      "While good sales people are fearless and want to tackle the world, they \n",
      "sometimes lack the inside knowledge and executive-level relationships to \n",
      "turn government initiatives and mandates into sales opportunities.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Good business development people set up opportunities and keep the sales \n",
      "force focused on high probability targets.  To use one more analogy, they \n",
      "ripen the fruit and lead the sales force to the orchard.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* TOOLS TO HELP GET IT DONE *\n",
      "\n",
      "At Fedmarket.com, we constantly extole the importance of locating \n",
      "opportunities early and building relationships with key government buyers \n",

AvocadoIT designates three priority response levels that it determines after consultation with Customer. \n",
      "Priority 1: Critical Business Impact \n",
      "Customer’s production use of the Software is stopped, or so severely impacted that Customer cannot reasonably continue work due to a problem with the Software not conforming to the Documentation.  AvocadoIT will begin work on the problem occurrence within 1 hour of notification and engage staff during normal business hours until resolution or workaround is achieved.   In the event that Customer has not selected Gold Customer Support, AvocadoIT will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with the option to engage AvocadoIT’s staff on a 24-hour by 7-day basis at then-current hourly rates (less 25% discount).  AvocadoIT’s Support Services staff will notify AvocadoIT’s Vice President of Professional Services and Support that Customer has reported a Priority 1 problem occurrence, and AvocadoIT will provide hourly updates (or at such other intervals as mutually agreed) to Customer of the status of the problem occurrence until resolution or workaround is achieved. \n",
      "Priority 2: Serious Business Impact \n",
      "Customer’s production use of the Software is continuing, but material or substantial features are unavailable such that there is a serious impact on Customer’s productivity due to a problem with the Software not conforming to the Documentation.  AvocadoIT will begin work within 4 hours of notification and engage staff during normal business hours until acceptable resolution or workaround is achieved.  AvocadoIT will provide Customer with the option to engage AvocadoIT’s staff on a 24-hour by 7-day basis at then-current hourly rates.  AvocadoIT will provide updates no less frequently than once every 4 hours (or at such other intervals as mutually agreed) to Customer of the status of the problem occurrence until resolution or workaround is achieved.\n",
      "Priority 3: Little or No Material Business Impact \n",
      "An immaterial aspect of the Software is unavailable and a workaround is available, or a less significant aspect of the Software is not available with no workaround due to a problem with the Software not conforming to the Documentation.  Customer has a loss of some operational functionality from the Software.  Customer will contact AvocadoIT during normal business hours and AvocadoIT will provide initial response regarding the support priority within 1 business day.  AvocadoIT may choose to address Priority 3 issues in a future release of the Software.\n",
      "Problem Determination   \n",
      "If AvocadoIT believes that a problem occurrence reported by Customer may be due to an error in the Software, AvocadoIT will use diligent and commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with a patch or workaround to restore proper operation of the Software.  \n",
      "If AvocadoIT believes that a problem occurrence reported by Customer may not be due to an error in Software, AvocadoIT will promptly notify Customer.  AvocadoIT will not be responsible for the resolution of any problem occurrence that is due to causes outside the direct control of AvocadoIT.  Customer may (i) instruct AvocadoIT to proceed with problem determination at Customer’s possible expense, or (ii) instruct AvocadoIT not to investigate the problem occurrence further.  If Customer requests that AvocadoIT proceed with problem determination at Customer’s possible expense and AvocadoIT determines that the error was not due to an error in the Software, Customer will pay AvocadoIT, at AvocadoIT’s then-current standard consulting rates, for all work performed in connection with such determination and reimburse AvocadoIT for any actual and reasonable related expenses.  Customer will not be liable for (i) problem determination or repair to the extent problems are due to AvocadoIT Software errors, (ii) any work performed under this section in excess of Customer’s instructions, or (iii) any work performed after Customer has notified AvocadoIT that it no longer wishes work on the problem determination to be continued at Customer’s expense.  If Customer instructs AvocadoIT that it does not wish the problem occurrence investigated at its possible expense, or if such determination requires effort in excess of Customer’s instructions, AvocadoIT may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the problem occurrence and will not incur liability for choosing not to do so.\n",

      "** INSTALLMENT 21: MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) CONTRACTS **\n",
      "\n",
      "* Overview of the Process *\n",
      "\n",
      "The General Service Administration's Federal Supply Service (FSS) \n",
      "operates the federal supply schedule program.  The program leverages \n",
      "the purchasing power of the U.S. government to garner volume discounts \n",
      "for commercial supplies and services. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under the program, FSS awards indefinite-delivery contracts and publishes \n",
      "catalogs reflecting these contracts.  These published catalogs are \n",
      "commonly referred to as \"federal supply schedules\" or simply \"schedules.\"  \n",
      "Using these, government buyers are allowed to place orders directly \n",
      "with vendors holding schedule contracts, and, in doing so, avoid \n",
      "traditional public bidding procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most Federal Supply Schedules are Multiple Award Schedules (MAS).  \n",
      "Under MAS contracts, GSA awards contracts to multiple companies \n",
      "supplying comparable services and products at varying prices.  The \n",
      "FSS operates over 100 different schedules covering most product and \n",
      "service categories. \n",
      "\n",
      "GSA awards MAS contracts to companies for commercial items when it \n",
      "determines that the prices offered are \"fair and reasonable.\"  \n",
      "Contracting officers make this determination by comparing the price \n",
      "or discounts that a company offers the government with the price or \n",
      "discounts that the company offers to its own commercial customers.  \n",
      "To make this comparison, MAS solicitations request offerors to \n",
      "disclose information about their commercial pricing policies and \n",
      "practices.  Contract prices are tied to commercial practice so that, \n",
      "in theory at least, GSA pricing remains competitive over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government buyers select from MAS contract vendors using the ordering \n",
      "procedures at FAR 8.404.  For orders under $2,500, buyers may order \n",
      "from any schedule vendor.  For orders over $2,500, buyers may search \n",
      "for items using, GSA Advantage, http://www.gsaadvantage.gov, or by \n",
      "checking three pricelists.  Buyers select a vendor by making a best \n",
      "value determination (price and other factors considered) and placing \n",
      "an order.  There is no advertising or competitive bidding, making life \n",
      "easier for both buyer and seller.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following (which comes straight out of the FSS Contractor Guide, http://apps.fss.gsa.gov/vendorguide/) is an outline of the process to \n",
      "get a MAS contract:\n",
      " \n",
      "· Acquisition Plan/Market Research is conducted. \n",
      "· FedBizOpps notice is issued -- for all solicitations. \n",
      "· Solicitation is issued covering various Special Items Numbers. \n",
      "· Offers are received and evaluated. \n",
      "· Contracting officer provides vendors opportunities to submit additional \n",
      "information when deficiencies in offer exist. \n",
      "· Contracting officer identifies best customer and prepares for \n",
      "negotiations. \n",
      "· Negotiations are conducted. \n",
      "· Proposal revisions are submitted. \n",
      "· Contracts awarded for multi-year period or offer is rejected. \n",
      "· Contractors are required to prepare and distribute an \"Authorized \n",
      "Federal Supply Schedule Pricelist.\" \n",
      "· The contractor is given a mailing list of federal ordering \n",
      "activities to contact. \n",
      "· GSA/FSS prints a Federal Supply Schedule document that is distributed \n",
      "through the Centralized Mailing List Service (CMLS). \n",
      "· As part of the contract award requirements, contractors are required \n",
      "to submit their pricing information electronically on GSA Advantage.  \n",
      "Contracting officer approves electronic submission. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Federal Supply Schedule Program for Medical Products and Services *\n",
      "\n",
      "The Veterans’ Administration (VA) has been delegated the authority to \n",
      "administer the Federal Supply Schedule Program for medical products and \n",
      "services.  These schedules encompass such products as pharmaceuticals; \n",
      "medical equipment and supplies; dental supplies; x-ray equipment and \n",
      "supplies (including medical and dental x-ray film); patient mobility \n",
      "devices (including wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, etc.); antiseptic \n",
      "skin cleansers, detergents and soaps; invitro diagnostics, reagents, \n",
      "test kits and sets; and clinical analyzers, laboratory cost-per-test.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a total of over 1,200 contracts in place for the various \n",
      "commodity groups.  Annual sales against these contracts exceed \n",
      "$2 billion.  Like all federal supply schedule contracts, VA contracts \n",
      "are multiple award, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type, and \n",
      "are national in scope.  These contracts are available for use by all \n",
      "federal agencies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To find VA schedule solicitation documents go to \n",
      "http://www.va.gov/oa&mm/busopp/sols.htm.  The schedule documents are \n",
      "shown first in the table with the issuing office designation \"VA \n",
      "National Acquisition Center.\"  Then click on the RFP number in the \n",
      "left column.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* Getting Your Products/Services on a GSA Schedule *\n",
      "\n",
      "Factors to consider \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting products/services on a GSA schedule is an arduous and troublesome \n",
      "undertaking for the uninitiated.  Expert companies will lead you through \n",
      "the process for $12,000 to $28,000 depending on the type of schedule and \n",
      "product set.  Small businesses with a limited number of products/services \n",
      "can expect costs on the lower end of this range.  You should have \n",
      "substantial projected sales to justify the investment required (in-house \n",
      "or outsourced) to get and maintain a schedule contract.  We can assist \n",
      "you in finding a firm to help you get on the GSA Schedule.  Call me \n",
      "(Richard White) at 888-661-4094 x18.  \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, what used to be \"bid and proposal\" costs can now be \n",
      "thought of as \"obtaining GSA schedule\" costs.  As a result, your costs \n",
      "in the future will drop compared to preparing individual bids or \n",
      "proposals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Schedules are not cost effective, though, unless you are serious about \n",
      "government business.  Putting it another way: getting and maintaining a \n",
      "schedule contract will be a waste of money unless you have a dedicated, \n",
      "focused government sales program. \n",
      "\n",
      "Complicated paperwork is the primary barrier to a small business \n",
      "obtaining a schedule.  The paperwork is daunting and most of the terms \n",
      "and conditions appear onerous.  Some terms and conditions are not \n",
      "legally and financially important while others are.  The trick is to \n",
      "know which ones are important (e.g., pricing terms) and how to comply \n",
      "with them. Even finding the GSA solicitation document on the Internet \n",
      "for your product/service can be confusing and frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know of small businesses that have obtained schedules, but they are \n",
      "usually experienced in selling to the government before they obtain a \n",
      "schedule, and they were tenacious enough to get through the mysterious \n",
      "and confusing GSA paperwork with in-house staff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through this email series we have stressed the need for a focused \n",
      "commitment before you enter the government market.  A small company \n",
      "obtaining a GSA schedule on its own is a prime -- and rare -- example \n",
      "of such a commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few more factors to consider: \n",
      "\n",
      "· Schedules are a government-preferred source of supply for commercial \n",
      "products and selected services. See FAR 8.001. \n",
      "\n",
      "· A schedule contract favors feature-rich, higher quality more expensive \n",
      "contractors because prices are based on your commercial prices and buys \n",
      "are based on \"best value,\" not lowest price. \n",
      "\n",
      "· Schedule contract buys do not have to be advertised in the \n",
      "FedBizOpps (the official web site for advertising procurements over \n",
      "$25,000) or subject to \"full and open\" competitive procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "· Buyers like using schedules because the purchase process is lightening \n",
      "fast, simple and rarely subject to protest. \n",
      "\n",
      "· Schedule contract buys no longer have an order size limitation.  \n",
      "Multi-million dollar orders can be processed using the schedule contract \n",
      "ordering procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "· Schedule contracts provide the basis for blanket purchase agreements \n",
      "for multi-year, preferred agreements between contractor and ordering \n",
      "agency. \n",
      "\n",
      "· Teaming arrangements allow two or more schedule contractors to propose \n",
      "and deliver multi-vendor solutions while using the GSA MAS ordering \n",
      "procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "· Credit cards and EFT may be used to simplify purchases and speed \n",
      "funds transfer. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Steps \n",
      "\n",
      "How do you get your products or services on a schedule?  The first \n",
      "step in the process is to identify which schedules cover your products \n",
      "or services.  A list can be found at http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/elib/Schedules.jsp;jsessionid=\n",
      "www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov-c8f%3A3ca4fcb1%3A72319d371b4ff55f \n",

      "The next step is to obtain a copy of Federal Supply Schedule \n",
      "solicitation for the products and services you want to offer.  The \n",
      "Federal Supply Service has regional offices and each region specializes \n",

      "scientific equipment is handled by an office in the Washington, DC area.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Negotiation Process \n",
      "\n",
      "Developing a proposal and negotiating a schedule contract is a \n",
      "complex process, far too detailed to discuss here.  In broad terms, \n",
      "however, these are the steps you'll have to take:\n",
      " \n",
      "· Gather company information on your company's financial condition, \n",
      "product/service prices, sales and discounting practices, and \"most \n",
      "favored customers.\" (Note: contracting officers possess the authority \n",
      "to examine your company's records to check up on your pricing \n",
      "information.) \n",
      "\n",
      "· Demonstrate how your proposed GSA prices are fair and reasonable \n",
      "in relation to your most favored customers.  (Because the fundamental \n",
      "goal of the MAS program is to obtain discount pricing, the contracting \n",
      "officer must analyze the differences between the terms and prices \n",
      "offered to the government and your company's commercial customers.) \n",
      "\n",
      "· Define your commercial terms and conditions clearly to justify \n",
      "exceptions to GSA's terms and conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the price analysis, the contracting officer will negotiate with \n",
      "your company, focusing on prices, discounts, warranties and any terms \n",
      "unique to your offer.  The contracting officer can award a contract when \n",
      "he is convinced that the negotiated prices are fair and reasonable AND \n",
      "comes to an agreement with you on the basis of negotiation and award of \n",
      "the contract.  The basis of the relationship between similarly-situated \n",
      "commercial customers and the government is one that must be maintained \n",
      "to assure the government that it is receiving competitive prices \n",
      "throughout the term of the agreement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing is the core of a GSA schedule contract -- both in negotiating \n",
      "prices and maintaining them consistent with your ongoing discounting \n",
      "practices.  Doing it right can make a significant difference on the \n",

      "Now here’s something that might surprise you after all that work: \n",
      "getting a GSA schedule contract guarantees you nothing.  You still \n",
      "have to find those individuals in government who need what you have, \n",
      "establish personal relationships with them, and sell them on your \n",

      "using your GSA schedule as an extra inducement in making the sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, a number of the big volume schedules are held by several \n",
      "thousand companies that will be competing against you.  Your schedule \n",
      "is a valuable tool for closing the sale, but it is no substitute for \n",
      "making the sale itself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the primary steps in the sales process: \n",

      "· Identify your schedule competitors and the differences, \n",
      "features, etc., of their competing products/services. \n",
      "\n",

      "buying is increasingly becoming the preferred practice in government \n",
      "sales.  GSA’s recent initiatives and future plans indicate that there \n",
      "is much more growth ahead: \n",
      "\n",
      "· GSA has implemented the \"Corporate Schedule,\" in effect a \"Schedule \n",
      "of Schedules\" for those companies that offer products in many categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "· GSA schedules are now \"Evergreen\" contracts, with a 5-year base and \n",
      "three 5-year option periods.  (And why not?  If the contractor keeps its \n",
      "pricing up-to-date at all times through the contract modification \n",
      "process, why should the contract ever end?)   \n",

      "** INSTALLMENT 25: PERFORMANCE-BASED CONTRACTING **\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal, state and local governments have engaged in performance-based \n",
      "contracting for a long time.  We've witnessed a dramatic upswing, \n",
      "however, in the last few of years, especially at the federal level.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Last year the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed agencies \n",
      "to use, in 2002, performance-based contracting for at least 20 percent \n",
      "of service contracts greater than $25,000.  The Pentagon has set a \n",
      "goal of 50 percent by 2005.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if they're not met (and they probably won't be), these ambitious \n",
      "goals demonstrate that the emphasis on performance-based contracting \n",
      "is here to stay.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In performance-based contracting, the government states its \n",
      "requirements in terms of desired results rather than detailed, \n",
      "procedural specifications.  The contractor decides how to perform \n",
      "and achieve the results.  Here's a definition provided by the Navy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Under PBSC, the government pays for results, not effort or process, \n",
      "and contractors are free to determine the best and most cost-effective \n",
      "ways to fulfill the government's needs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A more detailed description is set forth at FAR 37.601: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Performance-based contracting methods are intended to ensure that \n",
      "contractors achieve required performance quality levels and that \n",
      "total payment is related to the degree that services performed meet \n",
      "contract standards.  Performance-based contracts--\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather \n",
      "than the methods of performance of the work; \n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Use measurable performance standards (i.e., terms of quality, \n",
      "timeliness, quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans \n",
      "(see 46.103(a) and 46.401(a)); \n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to \n",
      "the price of a fixed-price contract when services are not performed \n",
      "or do not meet contract requirements (see 46.407); and \n",
      "\n",
      "(d) Include performance incentives where appropriate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* WORK STATEMENTS *\n",
      "\n",
      "While the concept is simple (pay based on performance), implementation \n",
      "isn't.  That's because performance-based work statements, which set \n",
      "the terms of payment and work to be performed, are difficult to draft. \n",
      "\n",
      "Think of the complexity of writing one for a contractor to operate \n",
      "a federal nuclear research facility.  You would need a formidable \n",
      "team of MBAs, industrial engineers, and efficiency experts to get \n",
      "the job done.  In this situation, how would you quantify performance \n",
      "quality?\n",
      "\n",
      "As you might expect, the government is having trouble writing practical \n",
      "performance-based work statements because they're often complex to \n",
      "write and because, on the whole, the acquisition work force is not \n",
      "yet adequately trained.\n",
      "\n",
      "* MARKET RESEARCH *\n",
      "\n",
      "A leading government guidebook on the subject (\"Guidebook for \n",
      "Performance-based Services Acquisition in the Department of Defense,\" http://www.acq.osd.mil/ar/doc/pbsaguide010201.pdf) emphasizes the \n",
      "importance of conducting market research.  Government acquisition \n",
      "personnel are to become \"informed consumers\" if they are to have \n",
      "any success in developing work statements.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One leading expert stresses that acquisition teams need to \"canvass\" \n",
      "contractors, asking such questions as: \n",
      "· What measures would they propose?\n",
      "· What incentives would they want?  How?\n",
      "· How would they want to report performance data?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is yet another example the importance of selling early and \n",
      "personally to government buyers and end-users.  You want to be in a \n",
      "position to assist in the market research effort.  You want to be \n",
      "\"canvassed\" (strange as that may sound).  You want to provide \n",
      "information on your company's services, help the acquisition team do \n",
      "its job and, hopefully, leave your imprint (however slight) on the \n",
      "resulting work statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another more subtle reason: crafting and responding to work statements \n",
      "requires that both sides--procurement people and contractors--have a \n",
      "clear understanding of an agency's program goals.  If you're not in \n",
      "the game early, you're not in the position to devise innovative \n",
      "solutions to meet those goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "* RISK-TAKING *\n",
      "\n",
      "Old-style cost-reimbursement contracting is safer for the government \n",
      "contractor.  Assuming you have a capable and caring staff, they \n",
      "basically have to go to work, do their jobs and you will get paid and \n",
      "make a profit.  Management need only have a good contract manager, \n",
      "leaving them the time to focus attention on winning new contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost-reimbursement contracts required procurement personnel to \n",
      "carefully detail what contractors were to do and how they were to \n",
      "do it.  To make up for the fact that laying out every detail is \n",
      "impossible, the resulting contracts often allowed reimbursement for \n",
      "extra costs.  Post-award cost adjustments were the norm.  In the \n",
      "old days, agencies assumed much of the costs of amended requirements, \n",
      "and even the costs of poor performance.\n",
      " \n",
      "Performance-based contracting, on the other hand, puts a premium on \n",
      "contract management, cost control, and your knowledge of precisely \n",
      "what the costs will be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Contractors don't have that \"wiggle room\" with performance-based \n",
      "contracts.  So the bottom line is this: you'd better know exactly\n",
      "what you're getting into and you'd better be innovative.  If you know \n",
      "your costs and agency program goals, and if you're creative in coming\n",
      "up with solutions, there is money to be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "* REPEAT CONTRACTS *\n",
      "\n",
      "What hasn't changed is that service contracts tend to \"repeat\" \n",
      "themselves.  Once you've landed a service contract, you can maintain \n",
      "current annual revenue levels by performing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "One caveat, however: there is an inherent appearance of impropriety \n",
      "if the government goes back to the same contractor over and over, \n",
      "even though that may be the best deal for the taxpayer.  Sometimes \n",
      "internal government politics cause re-competes to go to the wrong \n",
      "contractor.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of this, it is reasonably safe to assume that if you perform \n",
      "you will win next time around and maybe even a few more after that \n",
      "before the government gets nervous about the appearance of a level \n",
      "playing field.   \n",
      "\n",
      "As the incumbent you're the only one who really understands the \n",
      "contract requirements in the real world, and thus you're in the best \n",
      "position to bid a realistic price.  The danger of competition \n",
      "deliberately underbidding you, and making up the difference later \n",
      "with contract modifications, is reduced in performance-based \n",
      "contracting.  Why?  Again, because it's harder to negotiate contract \n",
      "modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "* SALES TIPS *\n",
      "\n",
      "· Get an even better understanding of the customer's requirements and \n",
      "perceived solutions than you might for a cost reimbursement opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Sell your ability and desire to meet performance-based goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Instill confidence in the customer that you will be able to perform \n",
      "under a performance-based contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Stress your experience in performing government performance-based \n",
      "contacts, if you can.  If not, substitute commercial experience.  \n",
      "Commercial experience carries more weight these days.\n",

      "SAP is extending maintenance on R/3 4.6C for an additional year--from the end of March 2005 to the end of March 2006. SAP is also extending maintenance on R/3 3.1I, 4.0B, 4.5B, and 4.6B, at no extra charge, by four months to the end of December 2003, and then for a 2% surcharge to December 2004. \n",
      "\n",
      "The upcoming release of SAP R/3 Enterprise is scheduled to start shipping in volume in January 2003, and the extension to pre-4.6C maintenance allows users more choice in their upgrade plans. It takes 7 to 10 months, on average, for SAP users to upgrade to R/3 4.6.C; the upgrade to R/3 Enterprise will be of similar scope. Without the maintenance extension, users would be forced to either start their migration to R/3 Enterprise prior to it shipping in volume or just upgrade to 4.6C. Since R/3 Enterprise represents SAP's future architecture, making it easier for users to move directly to it is a good move for SAP and its customers.\n",

For example, if a PDA has updated a business object, which the Server has previously deleted, the object will remain consistent with the server and the PDA will no longer have this object.

By providing this level of control, the AvocadoIT  Studio enables you to create an optimized user experience with device-specific rendering.   The AvocadoIT  Studio automatically generates a set of XML templates which describe the mobile application. These XML templates describe how to extract data from one or more data sources and how to render the application for a variety of device types. The AvocadoIT  Studio saves the XML templates to a database or file system for use by the AvocadoIT  Server at runtime.\n",

      "Offline: The developer designs the schema of the data as it lives on the PDA and how the data will be presented to the user.  The offline navigation path consists of a set of xHTML pages that are made part of the application at design time.  The designer can use any generic xHTML authoring tools to author the offline navigation paths.  Lastly, the definition of credential interfaces will be included as part of the synchronization information.  These credentials may be used to identify, authenticate filter or to process the request in some other way.  The AvocadoIT Offline Client Application provides for a very easy to use mechanism for communicating credentials to the Offline Server Application.\n",

The AvocadoIT Studio provides a GUI to allow you to point-and-click to select the area of the web page you want to mobilize.  The AvocadoIT Studio also provides advanced identification and pattern-matching technologies to ensure that this component identification will be highly resilient to web page modifications.

      "Brience (www.brience.com) was started a little over one year ago when Rod McGeary, former Vice Chair KPMG Consulting, took several partners with him and secured venture funding.  KPMG Consulting also has a stake in Brience and is their primary SI partner.  If you look at their customer list and partners, it is clear they leveraged old KPMG relationships  to get a few wins and secure partners such as Cisco.\n",

      "Apparently KPMG and Brience conducted a one day m-commerce strategy session with several Marriott execs and have offered  Marriott four people at no cost for one month to work on mobilizing Marriott.com.  Denis Edwards said that KPMG is really struggling at Marriott and they are offering free consulting to stay in the game. \n",

      "As for a comparison of AvocadoIT and Brience, while their marketing material sounds alot like ours, the fact is we are on the third major release of our software and have an impressive list of clients, some of which have been running for over a year on our platform.  From a technology perspective our Strategic Marketing Director has identified the following points:\n",
      "1) Their development tools are significantly behind the AvocadoIT Mobile Design Studio. Still planning on supporting multiple websites.  Their development tool is not able to extract and link/organize data at as granular a level as AvocadoIT and can not use multiple content sources to create single mobile app.\n",
      "2) Not able to support voice.\n",
      "3) Support for alerts is thin \n",
      "4) No offline capabilities in product; instead relies on 3d party wireline synchronization.\n",

      "Active Directory Deployments: Lessons Learned. Active Directory deployments will continue to split into two decision paths: as the strategic enterprise directory for applications, and as an important but secondary directory for Microsoft-centric applications and services. Although few deployments of Active Directory for extranet and e-business use have occurred, those deployments will increase in 2003/04 following Active Directory upgrades. Completed deployments will grow slowly (5%-15% of enterprises per year) and will be hampered in 2003 by confusion regarding .Net Server availability and readiness and Microsoft NT support issues. The role of Active Directory as a key element of identity infrastructure will be revised during 2004/05 to correct deficiencies in Active Directory, Windows security, single sign-on, and Microsoft's .Net strategy for Web services, resulting in further uncoupling of the directory from the Windows 2000 and XP environments. The most significant issue facing enterprises after deployment will be integration of Active Directory with other identity and credential stores within and among enterprises.\n",

      "Contextual Collaboration: The Road Ahead. An important information management trend this decade will be the shift away from collaboration suites (e.g., Exchange, Domino) toward smaller collaboration objects that can be embedded in business applications. This shift toward contextual collaboration will reduce collaboration costs of most business processes. However, this will initially raise integration costs and make applications more complex because of interapplication reliance and use of Web services. Companies will increasingly scrutinize internal and external business interactions for two factors: the degree to which the process depends on person-to-person collaboration and the efficiency of the interaction. Where processes require significant coordination but are carried out efficiently (e.g., in real time), little change will be required. Where processes are bogged down by human interaction (e.g., phone calls or e-mails unreturned, information lost, improper context), embedded collaboration services such as instant messaging, presence detection, calendars, or shared document repositories will alleviate inefficiency and latency.\n",

      "- Accenture has implemented/currently implementing three ePharma modules at clients\n",
      "- IMS and NDC are third party information sources\n",
      "- Professional, Accounts, and Activities are the three main tabs used\n",
      "- The Address area is somewhat different in ePharma than generic Siebel\n",
      "- Pre-call is a popular section for quick snapshot data\n",
      "- Profession Call is unique to ePharma\n",
      "- The Activities section is very specific for each client\n",
      "- Some pharmaceutical companies like the signature capture function\n",
      "- 2 of the 3 Accenture clients were dissatisfied with the Calendar function on Siebel Handheld\n",
      "- No Assessments section is available on Siebel Handheld\n",
      "- AvocadoIT should search for \"s_synd_data\" for existence of ePharma module in development copy of software\n",
      "- Siebel Handheld has no address requirement on some fields, but this is a very hard requirement with pharmaceutical clients\n",
      "- Dendrite is another established pharmaceutical related SFA package\n",
      "- Ability to hide columns is useful\n",

We are looking to see if there is a possibility to use our Siebel adpater. Once we get the meeting set-up with the Accenture team, we will be gauging how to position an HTML and Siebel Adapter solution. This next meeting will involve Peter. I have been keeping Peter abreast of all the developments. \n",

Since Damon is familiar with AvocadoIT through his work and association with the Kansas City Mobile Enablement Solution Center, he is recommending us and assesing AvantGo at the same time; Damon and his knowledge about us is how we got introduced into this opportunity.\n",

      "\n",
      "In selecting winning vendors, federal, state, and local governments \n",
      "have typically looked at past contract performance information as \n",
      "part of their overall evaluation processes.  Simply stated, vendors \n",
      "that have a history of performing well have always enjoyed a better \n",
      "chance of winning than those that do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "In late 1990s, however, the federal government began placing even \n",
      "more emphasis on past performance, codifying detailed past performance \n",
      "rules within the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).\n",
      "\n",
      "* COLLECTION OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION *\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the FAR, agencies prepare evaluations of contractor performance \n",
      "for each contract in excess of $100,000 from the time the work under \n",
      "the contract is completed.  Agency evaluations of contractor performance \n",
      "are supposed to be provided to the contractor \"as soon as practicable\" \n",
      "after completion of the evaluation.  Contractors have a minimum of 30 \n",
      "days to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information.\n",
      "Procedures allow input from the technical office, contracting office \n",
      "and, where appropriate, end-users of the product or service.\n",
      "\n",
      "* USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION IN EVALUATING RFP RESPONSES *\n",
      "\n",
      "The solicitation itself is supposed to describe the approach taken for \n",
      "evaluating past performance, including the evaluation of offerors with \n",
      "no relevant performance history, along with an opportunity to discuss \n",
      "past or current contracts (including both government and private) for \n",
      "work similar to the agency’s requirement.  Further, solicitations \n",
      "authorize offerors to provide information on any problems encountered \n",
      "in the past and to describe their corrective actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agency will consider the information you provide in your proposal, \n",
      "along with information obtained from \"any other sources.\"  What are \n",
      "these other sources?  Evaluators may call personnel within agencies \n",
      "you’ve worked for and begin to ask questions.  They may snoop around \n",
      "and talk to people not listed as references in your proposal.  And \n",
      "they probably will check past performance databases to see if you’re \n",
      "listed and what’s been said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government is beginning to centralize past performance \n",
      "information for large contracts.  For example, the past performance \n",
      "database of the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and DOD are being \n",
      "stored on a DOD server and will be available on the Internet (probably \n",
      "early 2003) for access by any contracting official.  The new system is \n",
      "called Past-Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), \n",
      "http://dodppais.navy.mil/.  We expect this trend to continue toward a \n",
      "single federal database for ALL agencies.  When will full centralization \n",
      "be a reality?  Probably sometime in this century.  (It’s the federal \n",
      "government we’re talking about.  It may take awhile.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t forget, information often is kept on smaller contracts as well, \n",
      "just more informally.  (The contracting officer (CO) only needs to make \n",
      "notes to the file when using past performance information in making \n",
      "small contract award decision, be consistent in using past performance \n",
      "information, and discuss negative performance with prospective offerors.) \n",
      "\n",
      "So, for both small and large contracts, it’s important to manage, as \n",
      "best you can, what’s being said about your company.  Negative \n",

      "Web Services: Stages of Adoption. Web services technology has been proposed as a mechanism for a wide variety of uses within the enterprise. The technology can be exploited as a remote-procedure-call mechanism, a component interface mechanism, an enterprise application integration (EAI)-style integration mechanism, a way of standardizing portal technologies, and a means of linking businesses over the Internet. The relative simplicity and future ubiquity makes it attractive for a wide variety of different technological issues. However, Web services' impact in most organizations will likely follow a predictable route, where certain aspects of the technology are used according to the major benefit areas and the costs associated with creating them. Web services benefits will be realized in stages, as adoption is phased into most organizations during the next two years.\n",

      "META Trend Update: Information Security Programs and Organization. As management realizes the challenges of implementing comprehensive information security controls, the security program will become one of the primary corporate IT initiatives for 40% of Global 2000 organizations in 2002 (60% by 2004). The success of such strategic programs will be inseparable from the effectiveness of the newly constituted consolidated security teams and their associated roles, responsibilities, and relationships within the organization. Most newly established security teams will continue struggling to establish credibility and influence within their organizations (2002/03), due to a lack of executive sponsorship, unclear mandates, and limited resources that impede effective communication. This will result in an unfortunate tendency for these teams to regress to seeking technology \"silver bullet\" solutions.\n",

      "Aligning Virtual Teams. IT organizations are increasingly supporting virtual teams. Prioritizing and implementing tools to cost-efficiently reaggregate these teams for consistent messaging and collaboration is the key to success with remote resources. As users become more distributed, integrated voice and data services become more valuable. Infrastructure professionals must provide \"the path\" for enterprises to \"follow the people.\" To learn more about this topic, listen to \"Aligning Virtual Teams,\" an audio briefing presented by META Group analysts Elizabeth Ussher and David Cearley, and view the accompanying slides.\n",

      "\n",
      "Highlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Biogen talked to 2 other vendors (AvantGo + 1 other) in addition to AvocadoIT; per Grant, the 3rd vendor did not have much to say and is probably not in the running\n",
      "- AvantGo still appears to be in the lead, with EP as number 2\n",
      "- The Biogen guys who came to our booth at the Siebel conference are 2 of the key decision makers\n",
      "- Per Grant, we did well in explaining the Siebel side of things and ok overall; according to Grant, we need a clear diagram to show replication and conflict resolution\n",
      "- Per Grant, we were pushing mobile connectivity too hard; Biogen is not interested in real time mobile connectivity or even a mobile disconnected (offline) solution; Grant mentioned that online connectivity + offline is not a key need for sales force at most pharma companies\n",
      "- Grant saw the need for real-time info in just a few cases, e.g. news oriented stuff...the Mapquest example did not evoke much enthusiasm\n",
      "- He commented that we didn't show anything from a Siebel perspective; would like to see things from a UI perspective that is relevant for pharma sales folks\n",

      "J2EE App Server Evolution: Survival of the Cheapest? Driven by the e-business hype of the dot-com boom, many organizations have invested heavily in Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application servers. However, few organizations are fully exploiting the benefits of this platform. Through 1H03 (given the tight economic climate), application server budgets will come under close scrutiny, with organizations seeking ways to reduce initial software license costs (typically $200K-$1M). Astute organizations will question the value of using an expensive high-end J2EE platform (i.e., BEA WebLogic, IBM WebSphere, iPlanet Application Server) for all projects. By 2004/05, 50% of organizations will have adopted a dual J2EE application server strategy, selecting both a commodity product and a high-end platform. This will force application server vendors to pursue a commodity market strategy, a niche high-end platform strategy, or a whole-product strategy (i.e., complement the app server with other platforms).\n",

      "Cellular Contract Negotiation Best Practices. Rapidly changing devices and networks will complicate North America mobile cellular buying decisions, necessitating better contract planning. Despite carrier consolidation, organizations that adhere to best practices can keep wireless voice costs in line and potentially reap significant savings. As new networks and business models emerge, contract negotiators must ensure that adequate protective contract terms and conditions are included. They should negotiate terms and conditions aggressively to obtain protection from industry changes. To learn more about this topic, listen to this audio briefing presented by analysts Peter Firstbrook and Dale Kutnick, and listen to the accompanying slides.\n",

      "Attaining and Maintaining the Right Portfolio of Competencies. Which elements of which IT skills are non-discretionary, which are discretionary, and which will be needed for higher-risk ventures? Building competencies should follow the strategic plan, which also implies a short-, medium-, and long-term planning horizon that must be considered. CIOs must build the processes for developing skills from their overall strategy. This is a challenge, given the requirement to adapt rapidly to changing business and technology demands. Yet it will be this capability that separates organizations; without the ability to rapidly leverage and build skills for deployment on a just-in-time basis, the ITO cannot fulfill the mandate to be a fully integrated partner to the enterprise.\n",

Following the Web hosting market bloodbath of 2000/01, Global 2000 organizations are carefully reviewing their outsourced Web hosting relationships.

      "\n",
      "System requirements are a pair of leased terminals in the customer service booth with a link to a central database, where the photos are stored and retrieved, via frame relay or a VPN. To be successful, the system must respond in 3 seconds or less, function without customer-invasive procedures, and be simple enough for a 16-year-old clerk to operate. Pricing is based on a 48-month lease, and the vendor claims that an ROI can be realized by catching only one fraudulent payroll check per month.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Will this method prevail versus fingerprint biometric offerings from BioPay, Biometric Access Corp., or Indivos? Certainly, consumers find this method less intrusive, but the major payment vendors Visa and MasterCard may choose to place a biometric fingerprint on their multi-application smart cards-checkmate. \n",

First, webMethods will support the Siebel Application Network: using the webMethods Integration Platform, webMethods will support process models that will extend beyond the boundaries of Siebel's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) suite for integration with disparate software packages. In addition, Siebel will announce that webMethods is the preferred real-time integration provider for its Partner Relationship Management (PRM) product line. While many integration vendors are mentioned with this announcement, webMethods is the only integration vendor to be OEMed by Siebel for the PRM suite and chosen to support the Siebel Application Network. \n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the Siebel Application Network, webMethods has secured an advantageous role as an OEM product that will be sold by Siebel.  The strength of the webMethods platform, the vendor's experience in the integration platform OEM space, and its close relationship with Siebel should put webMethods in a strong position to provide best-in-class support to Siebel customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "webMethods has carved out an enviable position in the integration space, developing intimate relationships with other leading software providers as well, including J.D. Edwards, SAP, i2, and now Siebel. As integration is a top priority for CIOs, relationships with the premier software vendors will continue to be advantageous for webMethods as it strives to become the de facto integration provider of choice. \n",

      "\n",
      "This afternoon we had a conference call with Accenture regarding the Biogen implementation. Of most interest to everyone was the Notes integration piece. According to Accenture, this feature will have to be delivered in release 1, currently scheduled for March 2002. This milestone is extremely important because it will be the initial rollout of the complete mobile infrastructure: services, clients, devices and the supporting organization. So at this point, the proposed application is Notes, not Siebel for the pocketPC. They are expecting Siebel offline to rollout later in France as part of a release 2 delivery in June. Worldwide distribution of the complete mobile solution is scheduled for Sept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, this raises the priority of the Notes integration. We had assumed that Accenture would be dealing with Notes, or an internal Biogen approach would address the issue, or that it wasn't a priority, none of which are true. So we must move forward with ThinAir integration, a Siebel/Notes approach, or some other means of easy and integrated (w/Siebel) sync for Notes: email, calendar, and contacts.\n",

      "March 2002\tNotes offline on pocketPC\n",
      "June 2002\tSiebel and Notes offline for France\n",
      "Sept 2002\tWorldwide rollout of offline\n",
      "\n",
      "And here's some additional information about the Siebel implementation:\n",
      "*\tThey are looking for localization: English, French and possibly German, in that order.\n",
      "*\tThe design phase is scheduled to finish at the end of Dec. This probably means they are looking to start development at the first of the year.\n",
      "*\tA development environment has been set up at Biogen in Cambridge. Most of the project activity will occur there.\n",
      "*\tThe March rollout starts in Germany, then the UK and follows through the rest of the European community.\n",
      "*\tThe June rollout for France is a separate milestone and coincides with their call center release to keep the code drops manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biogen project\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the project information will be saved on the network at:\n",

      "\n",
      "If you're interested, check for the latest documents in this folder. (I haven't had time to file anything there yet.)

      "A Solution for B2B Content. By 1H03, content network technology will evolve to provide the first viable solution to the B2B content value chain problem. Content in a B2B value chain is dynamic and extends along an almost infinite number of sources and integration points. The variety of B2B content illustrates the difficulties associated with even the most basic B2B value chain, and includes: product merchandising (e.g., pricing, product specifications, images), support (e.g., standard operating procedures, material and safety handling, forms, manuals), purchasing (e.g., RFI/RFQ, contracts, proposals), catalogs (e.g., components, suppliers, definitions, bill of materials), the ad hoc nature of content providers/consumers, and the security interests of individual organizations. Viable content networks will provide an evolutionary means for enterprises to securely access and manage B2B content along their value chains, removing bottlenecks and enabling significant cost reductions (e.g., duplication, latency, access).\n",

      "Server Management: Beyond Monitoring. META Group research indicates the primary cause of extended server outages is administrator error. A troubling aspect of this situation is that most server administration is performed manually and is becoming continually more complex, leading to more room for error. Although server monitoring has reached a reasonable level of maturity, automated server management is just now emerging as a necessity. This is driven by new application architectures employing larger numbers of smaller servers (horizontal scaling) to provide distributed power and high availability. Common \"server farm\" configurations (both consolidations and new infrastructure build-out), as well as emerging \"blade\" servers, lead systems administrators to a problem: keeping these servers in sync without drastically increasing staffing levels. Although hardware vendors provide administrative technology for their servers, these tools are often single-server-centric and single-vendor-centric, lacking the broad automation capability required.\n",

      "Web Analytics Catch-22. To jump-start investments in customer-facing Web sites, which have been slowed by strained IT budgets, Web managers must provide a business case derived from operational metrics. However, the high-end analytical solutions that provide these metrics are too costly for many industries. To learn more about how different types of Web analytic solutions map to various industries and Internet business strategies, listen to \"Web Analytics Catch-22,\" an audio briefing presented by META Group analysts Kurt Schlegel and David Cearley, and view the accompanying slides.\n",

      "Leslie was concerned that she had an undue amount of exposure on paid product licenses that she couldn't put into production without the professional services code drops.   I mentioned that we needed to be paid for the initial shipment, but understood the need to deliver the ps components for Notes integration on time.    As a strategy to meet in the middle, I offered that we would take a maintenance hit of one month for each week that we are late with a committed code drop.  That way we feel the pain of both delayed invoicing, and lost maintenance opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding payment, we were explicit that we would bill at shipment, and they would have 30 days to see the code and log a disupute for cutting the check.  Mark McCabe went over that several times with us, so we should gently remind Leslie.\n",

The ones that have drugs that are very expensive and need to administer those drugs as a complete treatment course do not give out samples to physicians. Biogen is one of them. In other cases, wha we showed Elan is pretty much standard. Most companies ave their own order tracking system and want to link order management to that system and hence that support in Siebel backend is not widely used. Signatures are never required to be shown back on the device and he will send me the details on which table stores signture. Hethe said if we are focusng on ePharma we should also look at the Physician's portal they have that allows doctors to check on the drug updates, feedback etc. \n",

The gy who heads his group in Bostonp reports to the Global services division headed by Carol Riley who came from IBM and that group reports to the sales organizatiom.

      "- Amitabh, Andy, and Ty on the call\n",
      "- Mark is the IT Manager at Biogen overseeing the RFI response\n",
      "- Call was fielded on the spot due to Mark's short window to talk\n",
      "- Biogen currently has homegrown SFA systems in place\n",
      "- Biogen looked at Siebel Handheld and did not like it\n",
      "\t+ Too much functionality on handheld\n",
      "\t+ Did not like the constant scrolling on HP Jornada 720\n",
      "\t+ Sales force did not really see the incremental value of hauling around a smaller laptop\n",
      "- With the introduction of another product, Biogen will quickly outgrow their current SFA system\n",
      "- All sales people have laptops today, none of which have Siebel loaded on them\n",
      "- The Siebel ePharma fat client has been bought and is planned to be installed on each laptop\n",
      "- Biogen has concern for lack of wireless network coverage today, prompting the current sentiment of the online wireless capability as more backburner for now\n",
      "- Conflict resolution is perceived to be a key differentiator for vendor choice\n",
      "- Talked about \"one touch synch\" for saleforce to cut down steps and ensuring accurate entry\n",
      "- The architecture diagrams shown in the RFI is an initial stance i.e. Biogen is open to suggestions from us\n",
      "- The current workforce is very spread out\n",
      "- One device standard is desired but will meet some organizational challenges\n",
      "- Biogen labs have assessed various devices, and the \"iPaq always wins the battle\"\n",
      "- Each Biogen rep will do 3-5 visits a day\n",

      "Aventis Pharma expands virtual detailing to enhance direct-to-physician communication (1/30/2002) \n",
      "\n",
      "BRIDGEWATER, New Jersey (January 29, 2002) - Aventis Pharmaceuticals ( aventis.com), the U.S. pharmaceuticals business of Aventis Pharma, has expanded its virtual detailing initiative to extend direct-to-physician sales and marketing channels using the Internet. According to Aventis Pharma, its three new virtual detailing programs are designed to span a wide range of technologies and complement the company's current iPhysicianNet platform for real-time live interaction. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Aventis Pharma revealed that the virtual detailing programs, which have been deployed over the past three months, are designed to use technology to target more than 50,000 physicians, including some based in hospitals and remote areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"By using multiple virtual detailing platforms and content formats, we provide physicians with relevant information at the right time, through convenient communication channels,\" said Michelle Runge, Vice President of North American e-business at Aventis. \"As part of Aventis' overall e-detailing goal to increase the quality and effectiveness of communications with physicians, all of our virtual detailing programs are integrated with other marketing activities including in-person sales visits and sampling.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "According to Aventis Pharma, preliminary results from its virtual detailing programs suggest that physicians' are likely to increase prescriptions based on clinical information presented. In addition, recent data collected by Aventis reveals that an average of 70 percent of virtual details are accessed by physicians during non-office hours and up to 60 percent of physicians request samples after a virtual detailing session.\n",

      "Ascending the Information Maturity Model: Part 1 - Data Quality. As information becomes recognized as a universally accepted business currency, a business performance fuel, an adhesive for business partnerships, and ultimately as a corporate asset, enterprises must adopt a method for gauging their \"information maturity\" - how well they manage and leverage information to achieve corporate goals. Only by measuring information maturity can organizations hope to put in place appropriate programs, policies, architecture, and infrastructure to manage and apply information better. Through 2004/05, data quality (DQ) will be the focus of information management improvement efforts, and DQ will be increasingly linked to business performance and value. Enterprises should begin adopting methods and indicators for gauging their DQ capabilities and level of maturity.\n",

      "A CFO for IT Organizations: Asset Management Is Coming of Age. Asset management (AM) programs are currently tasked with tracking and analyzing costs as a method of improving overall IT expenditures and efficiency. Although cost will always be an important focus for some organizations, others will shift priority toward new application deployment and develop portfolio management approaches to managing IT expenditures. This change will drive AM program leaders to assume additional responsibilities in delivering IT value to customers. Best-practice AM programs are already in the initial stages of developing additional value-add components, including strong communication links between internal IT departments and extending information requests into customers' planning processes. We believe this natural evolution will culminate in an asset center of excellence (A-COE) - a CFO-like function within the IT organization - dedicated to improving costs and generating improved IT value to customers.\n",

      "Worldwide Cellular Mobile Networks Migrate to Next Generation. Mobilizing enterprise applications will be a key challenge during the next five years. As mobile operators upgrade their networks to next-generation equipment, users are cautioned not to believe all the vendor hype. Bandwidth will increase gradually over time (staying at moderate levels until 2005+), and latency will continue to be an issue when delivering applications to mobile users. To learn more about this topic, listen to this audio briefing by META Group analysts Leif-Olof Wallin and David Cearley and view the accompanying slides.\n",

Yes, I had told Mark that to change the look and feel it is esy to midify the templates. But it was never in the context of the contract but as what our  technology can do when it was being compared toAvantgo. But if we are selling the solution(mPharma) to Biogen, and if they also need to tools/training to change the application that shoulb treated seperately. The training audience is different(Biogen developers) and the time line should also be different. I would also argue that they should be charged seperatly but that is a seperate business discussion.\n",

      "We have a product that will contribute towards reducing the communication challenges that face pharmaceutical companies during new product launches and on-going sales activities.

The trick now becomes the following – how do you get this customer information out to the field reps…and back from the field reps…during the 8 – 10 hours they’re in the field? This is where AvocadoIT comes in – we directly address this capability. The reason I am calling on you, (name), is to better understand the operational considerations associated with mobilizing your field reps. \n",

      "When we met with Navitaire this week, they implied that the date for the API is slipping.  I would not count on August.  When we spoke with the CIO of Jet Blue, it seemed like the voice piece was a pre-requisite for the data piece.  Is that still true?\n",
      "\n",
      "From what Navitaire said, Jet Blue is also interested in doing anything to get the lines down.  Navitaire specifically asked about our ability to support kiosks.  This would enable self check-in without all the cabling nightmare.  Another idea would be to propose an employee-wireless check-in (roving agent).  This could really help get the lines down.  All of this would require some back-end integration, but could be packaged and re-used with other airlines. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also there is also delay and cancellation alert automation where we can give them immediate ROI if they are using agents to do that now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I think we should continue to pursue Navitaire as a partner, I do not think we should wait for Navitaire to go after Jet Blue.  They have proven to be very slow.  Instead, I think we should get Jet Blue and then \"sell\" Jet Blue to Navitaire on the condition that Navitaire rolls our stuff to its other airlines.  A lofty goal, but not too far fetched.\n",

      "Chris, I have some good ROI models for the delay and cancellation alert automation applications.  Its not polished yet, but would certainly work if you wanted to use it to engage Jet Blue.\n",

We had a very good follow-up meeting with Navitaire at the Accenture Travel & Transportation Services meeting in Florida this week; you will be getting meeting notes shortly. We are developing Navitaire as a channel partner so that we can create one market offering for delivery to these start-up airline customers. The specific accounts we discussed as joint pursuits include Alaska, jetBlue, AirTran, and possibly some European regional players.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Armature quietly closed its doors on Friday and is now operating with a skeleton staff as it seeks a buyer.  Its demise doesn't come as a surprise.  The vendor had been struggling for at least three years through failed attempts to reposition itself in the fashion of the day, each time with a new management team: as a global enterprise application vendor for hard-line retailers, a multichannel grocery application vendor, and finally, a best-of-breed vendor for grocery replenishment and distribution in North America and the United Kingdom.  Each reincarnation failed for similar reasons: poor market timing (too early or too late) and an application portfolio that had evolved through a series of custom implementations under a service-revenue-driven business model.  Where it had once been strong--grocery retailing--it wasn't making short lists in the last two years, as JDA and Retek began winning the big deals in that market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Armature's demise leaves its few remaining clients hanging.  It's too late to implement the best risk mitigation strategy--good project management and up-to-date documentation of all Work-in-Progress (WIP) and pending deliverables.  Failing that, internal Information Technology (IT) and business teams should systematically shut down or suspend ongoing Armature projects, document the current status and condition of ongoing work, and initiate code escrow proceedings.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In an increasingly competitive business integration field, Impress Software is taking a bottom-up approach to the game. While the integration platform vendors, such as IBM, TIBCO, and webMethods, duke it out for framework supremacy, Impress is approaching integration from a highly specialized perspective. Founded in 1996, Impress first built a strong customer following by specifically targeting the need to integrate applications from Siebel Systems and SAP, attracting customers particularly where integration is required between multiple instances of one or both applications. Despite the seemingly narrow focus, tying Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) still lands near the top of application integration needs today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently, Impress has expanded to another specific business integration need by forming a cooperative partnership agreement with SAP in conjunction with an existing Primavera relationship. Working with these partners and a number of pilot customers, Impress will be offering a packaged integration system specifically for tying mySAP Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) into Primavera's project management system. Linking mySAP PLM and Primavera together is a significant step toward improving project execution and therefore reducing costs for major capital projects. This will help project managers to get better visibility into real-time cost and resource information and let them more proactively address deviations from a given project plan. In an environment where packaged integration must show an easily demonstrable return on investment and target a specific business need, Impress is picking its battles wisely.\n",

      "Overall, this project has huge visibility in Biogen. It includes 2 Siebel call\n",
      "center installations (US & Europe) as well as the Siebel ePharma CRM/SFA\n",
      "global roll out - which includes our mobile piece. The Biogen code name\n",
      "for the project is INSIGHT.\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT Proposal Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Software - $89K total - itemized as $69K for Mobile Siebel. 20K for Mobile Lotus PIM.\n",
      "Annual Software Support - $18K.    Biogen was given a significant discount in the course\n",
      "of the RFP process.  We waived fee for the AvocadoIT Mobile Siebel Server software and\n",
      "discounted the seat price by about 40%.  I reemphasized theses discounts numerous times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development & Implementation Services - capped at $150K, plus up to $50K for expenses.\n",
      "We credited Biogen with 30 days of service. Richard is figuring out what EP's actual\n",
      "work effort is so we can contrast this to Biogen cost of $150K.\n",

      "push for payment when we deliver the Notes PIM piece in Q1 and we install the Siebel\n",
      "piece on their server - also Q1.\n",
      "[Mark Tapling]  We are delivering software that works.  The things they want for production deployment are consulting projects; not products...in addition they want to install the product.  As a middle ground I suggest we book a firm software order, and offer payment terms to better map the cash outlay to the window of time we'll be making the first consulting deliverables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Payment schedule for software support - The old argument about actual deployment.\n",
      "They will say Siebel will not be deployed until June. We push for Q1 based on installing\n",
      "in their environment. [Mark Tapling]    Biogen is going to want to use the product, and get support.  I suggest that we start the maintenance clock, but extend the warranty from 90 to 180 days.  This way their investment is protected, but we can deliver the most current releases, answer their questions, and support their demo environment.  Not a direct hit, but ideally will get us in a better conversation. \n",

      "Payment schedule for services - Our project plan has 4 main Phases - Project Definition, Project\n",
      "Requirements, PIM, Siebel.   When do we want to invoice?  If we decided after each phase,\n",
      "then the customer must sign off on each phase, not wait until the end of the whole project\n",
      "to sign off.  We probably need to discuss this relative to revenue recognition implications.\n",
      "[Mark Tapling]  We can only recognize revenue as we deliver services and invoice.  We definitely want to go by phases.  The logic is that across the whole project there are many variables out of EPTH's control that could impact the completion of the project.  By dividing the project into measurable components, we can share any risk of delay.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The overall  Biogen IT project team pushback is \"This mobile piece has to go smoothly,\n",
      "we will not let it impact the overall project - we will walk away from mobile before we let\n",
      "that happen.\"  [Mark Tapling]  Not an irrational statement in a world of tough choices.  Still, they would not have gone this far with us if they didn't feel like they needed mobility.  Some positioning here....when we say if we don't get terms we can't meet your production dates...they say we won't wait for mobility.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Mark, I will confirm a final meeting time with you. The above was just a quick attempt\n",
      "to begin to get you the info you may need for the meeting.  I would be glad to review\n",

      "Wade and their field service support team is re-evaluating their current laptop/windows based approach.  They have 4,200 field techs that they support running mostly Panasonic Toughbooks using Broadbeam and ExpressQ.  Software upgrades and maintenence take 6-8 weeks to complete and they are interested in a browser-based solution -- and require off-line functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "They do have dedicated connections to both Cingular Interactive and Motient and have trialed a WAP gateway from NeoMar (they didn't like) and are just starting trial with Go America's gateway product.  I pressed Wade on whether gateway at Avaya was a requirement.  He only said that security was a major concern and thus far their IT group had only been comfortable with a hosted gateway solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the connections are in place to Cingular and Motient, he said the leading candidates thus far are RIM 850-957, but he also did not want to \"standardize\" -- that differences in coverage, tech preference meant supporting multiple devices was important.  They are absolutely CDPD haters, so asked him if CDMA card with Pocket PC would be of interest and he said he's appreciate it if we could facilitate an intro to Sprint PCS and/or Sierra/Novatel to trial that set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, he is very interested in discussing our off-line in conjuction with Siebel wireless and said he would make himself available for a joint meeting with Brian's team.  I said we'd be back in touch later in the week with a few choices of Siebel/AvocadoIT demo times near end of July.\n",

      "Kevin Chivers forwarded your letter about your program to enable pharma companies to use Siebel CRM served up to a mobile device.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Janssen-Cilag UK we are in the process of rolling out Siebel CRM to all of our sales force, currently using their laptops as the delivery device.  The last team will be up and running with Siebel sometime early in 2003.  Mobile computing and PDAs (or mini computers) is high on the agenda at the moment with several of our board directors asking when we will be using PDAs instead of laptops.  To date we have not seen technology up to the job, as all we have seen is vendor companies attempting to make the PDA do the job of the laptop, ie downloading a small slice of the customer database to the device, with all the slow speed and synchronisation problems you would expect.  Plus the fact that some companies have designed their own CRM software and would expect us to use that on the device, while using the data to feed into our Siebel database at head office (messy). The architecture you describe in your letter neatly overcomes these problems, with Siebel at its core, which is our company standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in the process of reviewing what is available on the market, with the aim of making a recomendadtion for our board to consider as to which product to go with, and when.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore I would like to talk with you about your product/service, please do get in touch.  I'm not sure if you will already have been in touch with any of my colleagues at Jannsen-Cilag UK already, if so and a meeting/presentation is planned, please could you invite me along?  I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss with you whether you have had any conversations with my colleagues to date, and if so what has been said....there are several of interested in this, but the time has come to start to make something happen!\n",

      "Here is the latest on the Biogen and Accenture client team front from our Accenture sponsors:\n",
      "\n",
      "Factoids\n",
      "- AvantGo is not a predetermined Biogen selection by any means as it stands today\n",
      "- Biogen expressed to Accenture its agreement and desire to look at other vendors besides AvantGo\n",
      "- Accenture client history with Biogen had some past, however tangential, objectivity remarks with Accenture promoting an alliance partner\n",
      "- In the interest of staying clear of objectivity issues, the Accenture client team has opted not to respond jointly to the RFI\n",
      "- The Accenture Client Partner has agreed to provide us time with an Accenture person based in Los Angeles who has a strong knowledge of Siebel and the ePharma module\n",
      "- We should answer the RFI and prepare for the demo with no mention to Biogen of our close working with Accenture, for now\n",
      "- If it is determined that Biogen has selected us for the \"final assessment\", the Accenture Biogen client team will engage with us more at that time\n",
      "- With research done by Ray, it looks like AvantGo may have a weakness in its support of PocketPC\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving Forward\n",
      "- I will contact Mark at Biogen to arrange a time for RFI clarifying questions (see message below)\n",
      "- Amit will get the contact info for Accenture Siebel person in LA to me for coordination\n",
      "\t+ We should plan for a half-day or so question session, perhaps one or two people flying down in person\n",
      "\t+ We need to verify if this person has ePharma demo application access in his physical location\n",
      "\t+ We should be prepared to ask this guy all our questions in this one shot\n",
      "\t+ We should have a fallback position if he cannot get us access to the actual ePharma application\n",
      "- We need to answer the RFI as an independent company with reference to things like support and integration with language along the lines of \"...Through our system integrator and other service provider partners, we are able to provide these services. Pricing and details will need to be coordinated through these partners. Details can be provided upon further request...\"\n",

      "Migrating From Chaotic to Coordinated Analytic Information Structures. Haphazardly planned, disconnected analytic data stores (ADSs - including data marts, data warehouses, and operational data stores) are a major target area for cutting redundancy, inefficiency, and waste. Duplicated data, development efforts, and infrastructure lead to excessive costs, lack of intra-enterprise coordination, and, ultimately, sub-optimal business performance. Through 2002/03, 80% of Global 2000 enterprises will make some effort to consolidate or integrate their disparate ADSs. By 2004/05, most enterprises will maintain a designated enterprise data warehouse or enterprise operational data store representing corporate \"versions of the truth.\" Users will be strongly discouraged from creating and accessing other analytic sources (e.g., personal extracts), and will do so only on an approved exception basis.\n",

      "\"x\"AN Interconnection: A WAN, LAN, SAN in a CAN. Proprietary server architectures will account for less than 10% of server sales (by volume) by 2005, as the commoditization of infrastructure components moves to all layers of server and server-to-input/output (I/O) infrastructure. All commoditized mainstream systems are similar in their physical designs, and differentiation will be related to operating system and interconnect use. Through 2004, server interconnect technologies (e.g., buses, switches, fibre channel) will blur for all physical hardware infrastructure (network, storage, and servers). Even so, it will be key for users to adopt distinct infrastructure and networks until technologies mature, bandwidth increases, and latency reduces, and until quality-of-service issues are addressed via infrastructure scaling. With server architecture becoming more predictable, associated systems maintenance and people/skill resources will be more important than the technology components themselves.\n",

      "Trends in Authentication and Encryption. Organizations have been struggling for years with how to enforce stronger authentication to critical resources. Encompassing internal, remote, and third-party (partner/customer) access, efforts have been driven by the enablement of more functionality and by the degradation of perimeter security (firewalling). However, technology for strong authentication is still immature and uncommon, and this will change only slowly. Organizations are also facing increasing requirements for encryption, driven by privacy regulations as well as distributed computing infrastructure, ease of access to systems, and pervasive computing. To learn more, listen to this audio briefing presented by META Group analysts David Thompson and David Cearley and view the accompanying slides.\n",

GLIC is also one of only ten companies with a Moody’s rating of Aa1 or better.  Founded in 1860, GLIC and its subsidiaries today provide almost three million people with life and disability income insurance, retirement services, and investment products such as mutual funds, securities, variable life insurance, and variable annuities.

      "As part of this initiative, GLIC is looking to select one or more technology service companies to provide an Enterprise Wireless Solution.

At minimum, GLIC would like the bidder to elaborate on how they will share the implementation risks of their solution at GLIC. In other words, if the software does not meet the expectation of business users at GLIC, what will the vendor do to rectify problems? For example, will the vendor offer free professional services beyond the amount specified in this RFP to ensure that the product is correctly installed and ready to be used? Will the vendor reimburse GLIC if GLIC chooses to abandon the solution due to its failure to meet GLIC’s requirements after the initial deployment?\n",

      "have handheld PCs in production but this is sufficient for the POC.\n",
      ">    - data source is html and cached on the laptop (our recommendation\n",
      "> is to use XML but we will work with html for the POC) Just so we\n",
      "understand each other, the data source will be HTML from a webserver, but\n",
      "the client-side environment will consist of xHTML templates and XML files\n",
      "storing the content (correct??).  Later we can work on having the source\n",
      "XML its self\n",
      ">    - changes are persisted until network is available for\n",
      "> synchronization Yes, mulitple entries of the same form\n",
      ">    - UI should be identical to the pages you sent As close as possible\n",
      "> 2. Are there any other requirements, such as:\n",
      ">    - platform, i.e. what laptop or Windows OS Win2000 OS - any laptop\n",
      ">    - any other application or system prerequisites\n",
      ">    - functionality other than what is described in your email It should\n",

      "> 3. What is your expected delivery for this POC? I'd like to show\n",
      "something by Thursday or Friday of next week if that is possible..\n",
      "> 4. How will we get access to the site? I'm assuming that you will take\n",
      "the HTML pages I sent and put those on a webserver that you have access to.\n",
      "Will it be available over the\n",

      "mirrors - we want to change the client list (manually?) on the server-side,\n",
      "sync, and have those changes replicated to the off-line content\n",

      "** INSTALLMENT 23: ACQUISITION PLANNING **\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout this installment series, we've tried to provide some \n",
      "insights that go beyond \"find bids/try to win.\"  And in doing so \n",
      "we've focused on themes such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "· Think beyond bid notices; find opportunities early.\n",
      "· Engage in direct personal sales (there's no substitute for it).\n",
      "· Focus on specific agencies (and the buyers and end-users therein) \n",
      "that need what you sell.\n",
      "· Understand the unique needs of end-users to earn trust, win \n",
      "contracts and perform well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps in no installment do these critical themes come together \n",
      "more neatly than in this one. \n",
      "\n",
      "* ACQUISITION PLAN: DEFINITION *\n",
      "\n",
      "What is an acquisition plan?  It's a document that shows what \n",
      "products and services are required, and how they are acquired, \n",
      "during the life of a given project.  More specifically, an \n",
      "acquisition plan: \n",
      "\n",
      "· Provides agency management with information for making procurement \n",
      "decisions and ensuring the availability of funding;\n",
      "· Provides technical evaluation personnel with adequate information \n",
      "for analyzing and evaluating vendor proposals; \n",
      "· Helps ensure that vendors have adequate information for preparing \n",
      "bids; and \n",
      "· Provides the source selection official with adequate information \n",
      "on which to base a selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s nothing magic or unique about government acquisition plans.  \n",
      "They can be found in the private sector, too.  But here’s the \n",
      "important difference: don’t expect your commercial customer to \n",
      "comply if you ask him to see the acquisition plan he’s been working \n",
      "on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* KNOWING IN ADVANCE *\n",
      "\n",
      "As with procurement forecasts and request for information announcements, \n",
      "tracking acquisition planning information is a critical way to \"get \n",
      "into the heads\" of government agency personnel involved in making \n",
      "purchasing decisions.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Within this context, when you try to speak with someone at an agency, \n",
      "you're looking for the acquisition planner.  Under the Federal \n",
      "Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the \"planner\" is the \"designated person \n",
      "or office responsible for developing and maintaining a written plan, \n",
      "or for the planning function in those acquisitions not requiring a \n",
      "written plan.\"  Planners are often program managers or the people \n",
      "who work for them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re on top of an agency’s acquisition planning, you’re seeing \n",
      "into the future.  If you know a planner and follow an acquisition \n",
      "plan from its initial stages, you are automatically following an \n",
      "opportunity EARLY.  The FAR states that \"[a]cquisition planning \n",
      "should begin as soon as the agency need is identified, preferably \n",
      "well in advance of the fiscal year in which contract award is \n",
      "necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAR outlines the information that is supposed to comprise the \n",
      "acquisition plan.  FAR 7.105.  Part of a planner’s \"Plan of Action\" \n",
      "is to list the prospective sources of supplies or services that can \n",
      "meet the agency's particular need.  Other information includes how \n",
      "competition will be sought, budget estimates, product and service \n",
      "descriptions, environmental and energy conservation objectives, \n",
      "security considerations, whether subcontract competition is both \n",
      "feasible and desirable and the types of source-selection procedures \n",
      "for the acquisition.  FAR 7.105(b). \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you have an acquisition plan in hand, you can find out in \n",
      "advance specifically what types of products and services the agency \n",
      "will be looking for, including unique features.  You can potentially \n",
      "uncover agency \"hot buttons\" well in advance of writing a proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "* FINDING PLANS AND PLANNERS *\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so where do you get your hands on acquisition plans and talk \n",
      "to the people behind them?  One way, of course, is to call procurement \n",
      "personnel within the target agency and just ask.  You can always \n",
      "start there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Another way: Internet research.  To give you some idea on the volume \n",
      "of acquisition planning information on the Web, go to Google.com and \n",
      "type the following into the search screen and click search:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"acquisition plan\" site:.gov\n",
      "\n",
      "(You'll be searching federal civilian agency web pages that contain \n",
      "the term \"acquisition plan.\"  Another search engine to try is \n",
      "Firstgov.com.)  The result is 224,000 returns, not all of them \n",
      "direct hits, but you get the idea -- there's a lot of acquisition \n",
      "planning information out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as we've said many times, you need to focus on the right agencies: \n",
      "the ones that buy what you sell.  Tracking acquisition planning \n",
      "information takes time, so don't waste your time in the wrong places. \n",
      "\n",
      "In doing Internet research, one way to focus is to use the right \n",
      "keywords.  Let's say you're a minority-owned company that manages \n",
      "government facilities.  If you add the keywords \"facilities \n",
      "management\" to your Google.com search (\"facilities management\" \n",
      "\"acquisition plan\" site:.gov), your first \"hit\" will be a National \n",
      "Science Foundation Annual Acquisition Plan Web page:  \n",
      "\n",
      "http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/cpo/contracts/acquisitionplan02.html\n",
      "\n",
      "Scroll down to the bottom of that page and you'll find a gold nugget.  \n",
      "In the first quarter of 2003, the agency plans to procure facilities \n",
      "management services from an 8(a) company.  It'll be a competitive \n",
      "procurement and the contract value will exceed $5 million.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All you've found so far is a simple table representing the plan, and \n",
      "yet the information is a critical first step.  Now you're focused.  \n",
      "Now you can call the agency to introduce yourself and find out more.  \n",
      "(Who's the incumbent?  How are they doing?  What can be done better? \n",
      "etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For an example of a state acquisition plan -- in this case from \n",
      "Tennessee -- go to \n",
      "http://www.state.tn.us/generalserv/purchasing/foreacq.pdf.  (Warning: \n",
      "this may take a while to load; it’s a 709 page .pdf document.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Internet research method of finding acquisition planning \n",
      "information works well for companies new to government contracting \n",
      "or otherwise not yet \"in\" with a particular agency.  Another tactic \n",
      "is to do targeted research on who buys what within a particular \n",
      "agency.  This will help you pinpoint the right people to speak with \n",
      "in order to locate relevant planning information.  Products such as \n",
      "our own FedBuying Intelligence (FBI), http://fbi.bidengine.com/, can \n",
      "be helpful in this regard.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you already have an established relationship with an agency, \n",
      "check out its web site.  In the National Science Foundation example, \n",
      "if you’d gone directly to the agency’s Contracts Branch page, http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/cpo/contracts/, you’d find these words: \n",
      "\"NSF Annual Acquisition Plan.\"  That text is linked to the page \n",
      "cited above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, don’t hesitate to ask procurement personnel you know about \n",
      "their acquisition planning.  Ask if you can assist in any way -- \n",
      "comments, suggestions, information on your products or services,  \n",
      "why they will help meet agency program goals, etc.  Ideally, of \n",
      "course, you’d like the items you sell to be part of the things \n",
      "deemed necessary within an acquisition plan.  Your company probably \n",
      "won’t be mentioned, but your products might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acquisition plans represent one more example of information that's \n",
      "out there to help you find customers.  It's just one more part of \n",
      "your arsenal -- an important one -- in winning government business.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Oracle's FY02 financial results reflect the company's battle on two fronts: a down technology buying climate and the aftermath of quality issues in its Applications business.  It reported net income of $2.2B on $9.7B of revenue, compared to $2.6B on almost $11B in FY01. From the stock's reaction, it appears Wall Street was satisfied with these results and a bit surprised with Oracle's tight management and control of expenses that let the company meet (reduced) expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The new license and update revenue for applications in Q4 was down 17% year over year. In comparison, this is a higher percentage decline than that experienced by SAP, PeopleSoft, and J. D. Edwards in their most recent reports. The difference probably reflects the large number of clients sitting on the fence waiting to start upgrade projects, which often carry additional license fees for new users and modules. If the new 11i7 quick install release due this month proves reliable in the field, much of this pent-up demand may generate revenue in the next two quarters. Oracle can't rush this release, however, but must stick to its new quality improvement plan for the long haul.\n",

      "Manhattan Is at the Apex of the Supply Chain Vendor Market Cap List \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At of the close of business on June 18, 2002, Manhattan Associates, not i2 Technologies or Manugistics, had the largest market cap of any primary supply chain vendor in the United States--$868.0M, versus $839.5M and $432.3M, respectively.  On December 19, 2000, 18 months ago, those companies had market caps of $1.2B, $19.6B, and $2.8B, respectively.  This shift highlights the success that Supply Chain Execution (SCE) vendors have had in the first half of 2002 from selling specifically to their customers' pain points while promising a quick Return on Investment (ROI). \n",
      "\n",
      "How this swing in market share will affect end users will take shape during the rest of 2002.  Manhattan's momentum, which shows no sign of slowing, will help in the following ways: \n",
      "\n",
      "*\tIt will pull more media and analyst focus to the execution side of the supply chain. \n",
      "*\tIt will highlight the importance of customer fulfillment and how SCE and logistics technology can solve those problems. \n",
      "*\tIt will provide Manhattan, and eventually other SCE vendors, with more traction in larger deals within the Global 2000. \n",
      "\n",
      "As this resonates with senior management, customer fulfillment will be a topic that can be discussed at the c-level, and not just in logistical circles. \n",
      "\n",
      "To get to the top, Manhattan's senior management team has delivered consistent growth to license and overall revenue, 35% and 18%, respectively, in 2001.  More importantly, Manhattan capitalized on its ability to execute in sales to ensure continued growth by doubling Research and Development (R&D) spending.  This has allowed it to hit the top, with the following advantages: \n",
      "\n",
      "*\tCloser functional parity across the suites of the iSeries for the AS/400 and n-Tier for open systems \n",
      "*\tStarting and enhancing its Microsoft-based Pronto suite \n",
      "*\tNew product features across all suites \n",
      "*\tExpansion of its general footprint \n",
      "\n",
      "One of those developments, InfoLink, represents about 3% of Manhattan's total revenue today, from approximately 30 deals.  The product was launched in September 2000 and is currently in its third release, adding stability to its code.  As we reported in our January 2001 Supply Chain Outlook, Warehouse Management Systems (WMSs) hold information that is vital to supply chain visibility and event management, as well as external-facing clients.  InfoLink, as a part of Manhattan's MA Collaborate suite, will become Manhattan's largest revenue creator in the next three to five years, delivering customer fulfillment.\n",

The rise of the big discount chains, including the world’s largest and most efficient retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, trendy Target, and upstart discount department store Kohl's, has come at the expense of traditional department stores, supermarkets, and struggling Kmart. Sears, May Department Stores, and Albertson's are among those that have lost market share as the value-driven retailers capture apparel and food sales that once belonged to them. With discounters expanding their product lines --and the competition retaliating by broadening theirs -- traditional retail channels are dissolving, a phenomenon known as channel blurring.

Keyword search will find every company name that matches your search term, but it also scours the entire text of every Hoover's Capsule and Profile for your term. This makes it quite useful for finding mentions of a particular product or service among all the companies that we cover. While it's not an exact science, Hoover's Company Keyword search is the best way to quickly create a list of companies that manufacture and/or sell the same product, regardless of their industry classification.

      "Why did 1Q02 not look too promising for vendors such as RSA Security, Entrust, Netegrity, and VeriSign? Is security no longer a top concern of organizations?  No, that can't be the case; time and again it is considered a top three IT spending priority. So what's the problem? Users have immediate priorities and long-term priorities, and the immediate ones are taking precedence.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft may be pursuing an acquisition of Danish low-end Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor Navision, according to reports in the business press. Navision, for its part, commented that it is in discussion regarding a strategic agreement with a company but does not confirm Microsoft's involvement in any way.  So why might Microsoft be interested in Navision, if it is at all, and is it a viable pairing?  And what would such a pairing mean to both companies? \n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft already has a low-end ERP product in Great Plains, but has received criticism lately that the product is not well suited to the European market, a niche Navision could fill.  Navision has a long track record, revenues of 200M euros and more than 1,000 employees worldwide across 29 countries. But the most important asset, with the possible exception of the product, is the distribution channel of more than 2,000 partners across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Navision is a rare animal, its product set forms a kernel to which partners add local industry-focused functionality to satisfy the diverse European Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) market. As a result, the channel is well versed in business process and Microsoft's technology, an enticing combination for Microsoft, which is desperate to add business people to its technology-led ranks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft would hardly notice the dent in its bank balance, but would control credible products and channels on both sides of the Atlantic against other low-end SME vendors such as TopManage, the latest acquisition by SAP.  For Navision, the impact would be greater, internally and externally.  For employees, there would likely be some attrition, but Microsoft would need business-savvy personnel to control the channel and further develop the product. Externally it would boost Navision's ability to market the product across Europe. If Microsoft is in talks with Navision, the pairing makes some sense, and if it is not in talks, maybe it should be.  If not Microsoft, then who might it be? It could be SSA GT, which seems to be on the acquisition trail with the purchase of the interBiz products from Computer Associates, although the likely asking price of around $1B would probably require a bigger fish. It could also be J.D. Edwards, which might be interested in a route to the low-end SME market. But both of these companies would likely only require the channel, not the product, leaving the Navision software to wallow. These are also unlikely candidates because of the channel's Microsoft bias. For now it's all speculation, but it makes enough sense to possibly be true.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "IBM and Peregrine formed a strategic alliance that brings together software infrastructure and services from IBM, and infrastructure management from Peregrine.  The combination will be targeted at several industry segments, including Telecommunications, Public Sector, and Financial Services.  The agreement included joint marketing, selling, and implementation services.  Peregrine will also be optimizing its products for the Websphere and DB2 platforms and integrating with the MQ Series family.  IBM Global Services will also be incorporating the Peregrine products into its industry solution maps. \n",
      "\n",
      "Partnerships in the software industry can be confusing and often are not worth more than the paper the press release is written on.  To measure the success of partnerships, it is important to look at whether the two companies are integrating at a technology level while also providing joint marketing and sales.  The technology integration can be difficult and often reflects a deeper commitment between the parties.  Peregrine and IBM were already partners, but this shows that the partnership has been successful, and now the companies are stepping it up a level.  It is critical for the vendors to follow through on the technology integration, for that is where the cost savings and benefit often lie for their customers.\n",

      "Organizing the Command Center of Excellence. The command center of excellence (C-COE) performs command-and-control and monitoring functions across operational technology silos. Currently, 40% of Global 2000 organizations have embarked on command centers with an ultimate goal of achieving C-COE maturity levels. After first defining operational processes independent of technology solutions and organizational issues, enterprises must identify an organizational structure under the correct management chain and staffed with the appropriate skill sets. In most cases, reorganization will be required, because personnel are typically distributed among technology silos (e.g., network, Unix, applications). The most effective structure to emerge is one with two teams: an engineering team responsible for developing and maintaining the processes and technology solutions and an operations team that performs the actual duties of the command center, including monitoring, initial support tiers, and escalation.\n",

      "Metrics Required to Prove a Portal's Worth. With the cost for multiyear portal deployments often exceeding $10 million, portal business justification has become a top concern. Most predeployment justifications use pro forma estimates of productivity improvements, cost savings, and increased revenue opportunities, but these estimates are frequently disregarded once the project is approved. Increasingly, IT managers will deploy portals with analytics built as a design construct to feed operational metrics that can justify portal investments over time. Although the specific portal metrics tracked will vary for each deployment based on the purpose and community type, portal metric categories common for all companies will evolve based on the three functions of a portal framework: collaboration, content management, and application integration. Collecting operational metrics will help prevent portal failures by quickly identifying underlying problems of the portal's usage and efficacy.\n",

      "Gaps in Business Continuity Best Practices. Many disaster recovery/business continuity (DR/BC) plans have significant gaps or issues. For example, one-third of organizations do not regularly validate their data backups (i.e., check that backups can be recalled in a timely manner and data can be read). An equal number of DR/BC plans do not include recovery \"sequences\" for business functions. More than half do not deal with possible telecom outages. Other problems include a lack of executive sponsorship, and fixation on business continuity as a project rather than an ongoing process that must reflect business changes. To learn more about business continuity gaps and best practices, listen to this audio briefing, presented by META Group analysts Herb VanHook and Val Sribar, and view the accompanying slides.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M-businesses need to meet mobile users' needs regardless of the devices the users have, the applications being accessed, the connectivity available, or the users' locations.  The best model for m-business is one that concentrates on the mobile user's needs, not on the device or application.  Successful m-businesses always will provide the mobile user with a comfortable, convenient and intuitive interaction. A typical mobile user should be able to transition from a networked PC to a wireless pager to a synchronized palmtop device, and get the appropriate information based on his needs when he uses each device.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M-businesses should provide a single address through which all mobile users can reach the business.  Once the user is identified, his/her profile should determine what information and links are presented.  Users should not need to remember several URLs to get to multiple applications.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile device designs will continue to proliferate.  M-businesses will need to accommodate all devices as they become available.  Additionally, m-businesses should exploit the unique features of each device. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M-businesses will need to \"mobilize\" their enterprise infrastructure and applications without adversely impacting either.   This requires using the APIs provided by the backend system vendors, and being sensitive to the additional load that wireless users will put on the infrastructure.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The m-business environment will be one of rapid application development.  Wireless applications will be developed, tested and deployed quickly, and then undergo iterations of improvement over their lifetime.  When extending applications to a mobile environment, application developers should be able to use familiar development tools and programming languages.  Developers should have direct access to code so they can modify it when necessary.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the m-business environment often will involve transmitting proprietary data via a public network, security, in the forms of authentication and encryption, needs to be applied from the firewall to the device.  Also, information residing on devices themselves will need to be secured, in case a device is stolen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of wireless communications, no wireless carrier and no transmission protocol will provide a total global solution.  M-businesses will need to accommodate a patchwork of incompatible standards for the foreseeable future.  In general, transmission speeds will be relatively slow.  To conserve bandwidth m-businesses will need to develop effective workflow processes and user interfaces.  The unreliability and slow transmission speeds of wireless networks requires that synchronization be a part of any mobile solution.  In the realm of synchronization, successful m-businesses will incorporate SyncML into its solution, since this is the closest thing to synchronization standard.\n",

Next, we will implement a mobile CRM solution based on Siebel CRM software.  Later initiatives include mobilizing additional Lotus Notes databases and workflow applications, mobilizing Oracle applications and databases, and mobilizing a variety of other legacy systems for employees, customers, suppliers and partners.\n",

      "Does Language Matter? Traditionally, programming languages have been designed to solve specific problems or address specific domains (e.g., COBOL and business records, C and operating systems, Perl and document processing). However, since the emergence of object-oriented languages, differences have been downplayed. Java pushes this concept completely with a one-language-for-everything concept. Still, almost all organizations will continue to use multiple application languages. With the arrival of the Microsoft .Net platform, development organizations have the option to utilize four supported languages from Microsoft (Visual Basic, C/C++, C#, J#) along with third-party languages (e.g., Lahey FORTRAN, Fujitsu COBOL, ISE Eiffel, ActiveState Perl and Python). Organizations with Microsoft developer skills should evaluate the use of the .Net platform to replace existing ASP (Active Server Pages) and Windows applications.\n",

      "Offshore Outsourcing Amid International Uncertainty. Recent deterioration in relations between Pakistan and India has raised concerns because 80% of offshore outsourcing is done in India. Although we encourage IT organizations to assess risk to strategic projects (both maintenance of existing data assets and new development efforts), IT managers must broaden the evaluation to include uncertainty stemming from international unrest generally. To learn more about offshore outsourcing risk assessment, listen to this 10-minute audio briefing presented by META Group analysts Dean Davison and Val Sribar.\n",

      "Storage Infrastructure Management Will Determine Business Agility. The lack of robust, effective, enterprisewide data and media centers of excellence (D&M COEs) in Global 2000 organizations has resulted in the current preponderance of fragmented, platform-specific solutions that impede time to market, diminish availability, increase costs, and ultimately limit the business's ability to grow its information lifeblood. We believe this growing conflict between organic business information growth and immature management processes and automation will drive users toward the enterprise efficiencies of the D&M COE. Moreover, as users develop the COE structure, they must closely align the D&M and asset COEs to ensure conformity, standardization, and optimal exploitation of the rapidly growing storage infrastructure. Specifically, we believe asset management by granular, aged costing will yield a leaner, more efficient storage budget and enable more affordable capacity growth.\n",

Now MGM Mirage has become the first big player to secure a license to set up its own online casino, on the Isle of Man. Read more. \n",

      "Application Portal or Portal Application? As portal frameworks have become a primary e-business investment area, vendors have jumped on the bandwagon. SAP has been the most active ERP vendor in the space. Oracle, in the portal market for some time, has been an aggressive portal marketer. PeopleSoft is on the verge of entering the portal market as a best-of-breed player. Siebel is attempting to vault the portal market with a potentially more comprehensive message in \"Employee Relationship Management.\" All the ERP vendors (Baan, JD Edwards, and Lawson) now have a portal framework story. For many of our clients, rationalizing a decision for or against an ERP vendor's portal for B2E, B2B, and even B2C environments has become a difficult task. Independent and other platform vendors may still be the right choice in many situations.\n",

      "Global Mobile Trend Update. Higher bandwidth over cellular networks is slowly becoming reality. The hype surrounding 3G has turned into widespread disbelief when it comes to available bandwidth, coverage, and rollout plans, compounded by the difficult financial situation of many mobile operators. Users with pressing needs to deploy mobile applications should focus on existing, proven technology (2G and 2.5G) from financially viable mobile operators, and not wait for 3G to become mature with the necessary coverage. Most of the advantages that 3G promises are provided by 2.5G, but without the associated risks. Best-practice applications should be developed to be as network-agnostic as possible regarding transport/transmission and target devices.\n",

      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT, the leading solutions provider for the wireless web, would like to invite Fed Ex to join the wireless web and be ready for the upcoming voice web.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This proposal outlines how AvocadoIT will take Fed Ex onto the wireless web as well as describes the market opportunity and how AvocadoIT enables Fed Ex to join the wireless web faster, with more devices, and value justified when compared with any other solution available today.\n",
      "\n",
      "As described in detail further in this contract, AvocadoIT will enable Fed Ex sales force application(s) on the PDA and Wap Phone devices by March 31st, 2001 for $89,200 of development fee for online and $60,000 for offline capabilities and a monthly service fee or licensed server fee.  This includes application development, hosting, security, hardware, software, monitoring, reporting, and network connectivity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Market Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first evolution of interacting with the applications, via the PC, has progressed to a plateau where the number of users is increasing at a much slower rate.  The second evolution of Internet interaction, via wireless devices, is now upon us.  We are also on the verge of the third evolution of interacting with the Internet, via voice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The original evolution of the Internet created a market discontinuity that punished client-server and brick and mortar based businesses that did not adopt early.  This market discontinuity is similar to the discontinuity that was created by the shift from mainframe technology to client-server.  In each of those instances, the companies who embraced the technology flourished while those who did not faltered.  In addition, new companies based on the new technology of the market shift rose to take the place of the older companies that did not embrace the shift.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Wireless Internet is creating the same market discontinuity today, as voice Internet will tomorrow.  Companies who are first to market with these new solutions will create a substantial lead over companies who are slow or do not embrace wireless Internet and voice Internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although interaction with the Internet via PC’s will never go away, it will soon pale in comparison with interaction via wireless devices to the point where Nokia is predicted to become the world’s largest “PC” manufacturer.  While interaction with this large number of wireless devices is considered to be a great opportunity by visionaries, analysts, and businesses alike, this opportunity is further eclipsed by the interaction with the enormous installed base of regular home phones, pay phones, and cellular phones.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these wireless devices are already here.  In addition, there are also new wireless devices that are being introduced everyday.  Each of these devices can have a different operating system, different screen size, and/or different browser, each of which presents a different challenge for a business looking to mobilize its users.   \n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT enables Fed Ex to embrace and lead this market discontinuity by implementing a wireless solution that can be used to link your current and future Internet, Intranet, Extranet, and enterprise applications with any current and future device that gains market acceptance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT enables Fed Ex to focus time, funding, and resources on implementing a single website for PC access and leverage this site for interaction with the plethora of new devices hitting the market everyday.  This means that Fed Ex never has to worry about separate applications for each device, resources to hire or train to implement these applications, or the costs and time it takes to implement, maintain, and update these applications. \n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT provides the following benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "Use of your existing website - no changes required\n",
      "\n",
      "Completely secure data model\n",
      "\n",
      "Support for multiple devices with a single infrastructure \n",

      "AvocadoIT’s solution leverages our customers’ existing Web infrastructures by intelligently rendering the dynamic content, commerce transactions and static content currently available on a website.  Unlike other solutions, AvocadoIT renders existing Web information in a method where a single solution enables numerous devices to receive Web content customized for each device.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The rendering process is accomplished using the AvocadoIT Rendering Tool, our user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).  The AvocadoIT Rendering Tool is used to select not only particular items on the Web page to render, but also which specific sections of that particular item to render.  The ease of use of the AvocadoIT Rendering Tool enables the rendering of pages in an extremely short amount of time.  Once the rendering has been completed, the resulting information is stored in a database in the AvocadoIT server where it will be used when that particular Web page is accessed by an alternative Internet device.  Hence, the AvocadoIT server appears to the company’s website as a normal Web browser and accesses the Web information from the item or area of the Web page that was rendered by the GUI. \n",
      "\n",
      "The AvocadoIT approach is unique in that while other methodologies view the delivery of information to devices as individual applications specific to particular devices, AvocadoIT views the information as Web content.  While this may appear initially as a subtle difference, it has a profound effect on the use of a single solution for any number of existing or new alternative Internet devices.  Therefore, any business can now use the AvocadoIT solution to reuse their existing investment in Web content and commerce for delivery to a multitude of new Internet devices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Approaches \n",
      "\n",
      "Some companies have used other approaches in an attempt to connect alternative devices to the Internet. These efforts fall into two broad categories: separate applications (systems integration and application toolkits) or web-based (mark-up tags, new languages, translators and scripting). All of these alternatives are either too expensive and time consuming or produce unacceptable formats.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Separate Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Systems Integration approaches, in reality, build an entirely new application that does not reuse your expensive and extensive website.  While the initial implementation of a systems integration approach is much more expensive than AvocadoIT, the real expense comes in the maintenance, updates, and upgrades, especially in terms of time and resources, that will be required after the initial implementation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, adding a feature to your website will mean that the application will have to be re-written with a systems integration approach.  In addition, new devices, such as voice browsers will require an entirely new application in addition to the website and the systems integration application for wireless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Application Toolkits also require a entirely new application independent of your website or voice access solution.  Application toolkits differ from systems integration approaches in that toolkits provide more structure in the development of the application, but still burden you with lingering effects of maintenance, updates, and upgrades as described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Web-based solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark-up tags require significant changes in the existing website in order to place the correct tags in the correct location.  Two device-specific mark-up tags cannot be used on the same item on a Web page.  This means implementing different Web infrastructures for each type of device as well as the maintenance to maintain the continuity between devices.  In addition, mark-up tags insert code into the Web page.  This is not acceptable for complex Web applications that have evolved over time and have reached a level of reliability that may be compromised if the existing logic is altered.  \n",
      "\n",
      "New languages, such as Voice XML and WAP Forum’s WML and HDML, do not reuse existing Web infrastructure and require writing new applications in these languages. This approach relies on a critical mass of Web applications being rewritten for these new languages  - a scenario that at best will take a long time and at worst may not happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dumb Translators use automatic conversion routines to convert HTML pages to match the capabilities of the target device.  In effect, translators will strip out pre-defined objects such as graphics, tables, URL’s, etc and send the rest towards the device.  There is no intelligence in defining the specific information that will be sent to a specific device.  In addition, most translators cannot handle Java scripting.  However, this solution is not scalable and provides very limited capabilities for customizing the delivery onto target devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scripting involves writing a specific script for each Web page.  In effect, scripting can be compared to reprogramming since a script would have to be written for every page.  Scripts are written in text-based regular expressions, which are a form of programming.  Scripting is an extremely maintenance-intensive approach, since any change in the scripted page will cause the entire Web page to be re-scripted.  \n",

      "AvocadoIT operates as an Application Service Provider (ASP).  We provide the application development, hosting service, maintenance, support, servers and software.  With Fed Ex application specification, AvocadoIT provides the complete solution. \n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT has partnered with first tier co-location vendors to host our services and provide 24x7 data center operations.  We will manage all aspects of the production environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fed Ex’s application will be fully tracked and managed by an AvocadoIT Project Manager.  The Project Manager will be responsible for all aspects of the application development, specifications, conducting project meetings, managing the project timeline, communicating with Fed Ex’s primary technical/project contact and managing all resources internal to AvocadoIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT will provide Fed Ex with Platinum level of support.  This includes 24x7 second line technical support as well as a dedicated account manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Portability\n",
      "\n",
      "Although AvocadoIT operates as an ASP today, we realize that Fed Ex may want to bring this solution in-house.  We are working to provide an option to license our technology.  Our product is written in Java and can be easily ported to a number of operating systems.  More than the portability of our product (server), our application designer tool is GUI based and does not require a programmer to use.  A knowledge worker familiar with the Web Application will be able to map out and customize the flow of the components onto the different devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Adaptability\n",
      "\n",
      "Devices. The AvocadoIT solution is XML based and is engineered to support all devices, now and in the future.  Currently we support WAP, PDA, two-way pagers and Internet-Over-Voice using text-to-speech and speech recognition.  For WAP, we support both HDML and WML. Each of these protocols will use the same solution and same rendering of the Fed Ex website as well as any other devices Fed Ex may want to deploy in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Sources.  Since the AvocadoIT solution is XML based, it is architected with the ability to support your website as you move to XML or other data sources.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Application. Since the AvocadoIT solution uses Fed Ex’s existing Web infrastructure as the application for all existing and new devices, Fed Ex can keep a single point of development, logic and maintenance for all PC and non-PC devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Customization. Our solution can be customized for each device.  For instance, on a PDA, the Web content can be displayed in full sentences such as “Items I’m Selling” or “Items I’m Bidding On”.  On a SmartPhone the choices may read: “Items Selling” and “Items Bidding”.  On a voice application it could speak; “Please choose one of the following: Items I’m selling, MyAccount, Item’s I’m bidding on, or favorite categories”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personalization. Our solution has been engineered with the vision that a consumer may want to customize their view of websites for different devices in the future. Once this personalization has been implemented,  Fed Ex customer will be able to customize his own view on a device-specific basis.  He could customize a view to see ‘Items I’m bidding on’ and ‘Favorite Categories’ only. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mixed media.  The most convenient input and output modes on a WML/HDML SmartPhone are voice input and viewable data output.  We will support dual mode input and output once the phones support dual WML/HDML-voice modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adaptable to change.  AvocadoIT’s rendering mechanism is resilient to modifications to the Web page.  It identifies components on the website by various characteristics of its digital signature.  It is not sensitive to changes in a component’s position on the page, adding non-rendered information to a table or removing non-rendered information from a table.  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitoring and corrective action.  AvocadoIT’s technical support group and our vendors provide 24x7 monitoring of the production systems.  All devices are pinged on a regular schedule with immediate notification of failure.  A system management tool will provide application level alerts through a console alarm (monitored 24x7) and E-mail or pager, where appropriate.  Application and systems logs are also regularly checked to identify any potential problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If a system goes down, the highest priority is placed on safely and securely restoring full operations.  A secondary concern is capturing information on the particular incident.

      "Scalability\n",
      "\n",
      "Our servers are linearly scalable.  Our servers do not share any resources, except access to the website.  Since the website is serviced by a distributed collection of machines, is not truly a single point of contention.  Therefore if the load on the system increases as a step function, we can meet the increased demand by adding more hardware.  The hardware and software configuration for each new machine is identical to the existing machines; there is nothing unique about each server.  Thus we can meet increased capacity requirements as fast the hardware vendor can deliver the servers.\n",

Access is provided only to authorized personnel through card access or biometric scanning devices.  Our equipment is further secured in locked racks and cages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Network security. AvocadoIT servers are separated from the network by the appropriate firewall technology: address translation, packet filtering and proxies.  For communications over the Internet we support:\n",

      "Of course the most widely used device is and will continue to be the plain old voice telephone, which accounts for all home phones, office phones, payphones, and every type of cellular phone (including those enabled for Internet access).\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, only 47% of the US population has Internet access; this statistic is significantly lower abroad.  This is due, in part, to the reality that a large percentage of the world’s population cannot afford a PC or is afraid to use one.  Telephones offer a global solution to this problem.  They are one of the few devices used cross-demographically because they are inexpensive, user friendly, and are available on almost every street corner.  With the increasing number and popularity of voice portals, the universal availability of plain old telephones will give way to a myriad of new Internet subscribers.\n",

      "I had a chance to catch up with Tom Leslie (Senior Manager, Accenture Toronto, Financial Services) today to talk about CRM activities at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In our conversation, I found out some details on the landscape of activity going on at RBC. The following are details that would be relevant specifically for RBC and more data points for our work with Siebel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accenture Activity at RBC\n",
      "- Primarily in the RBC Investments Group\n",
      "- Accenture was engaged to address CRM initiatives\n",
      "- Accenture took the lead in evaluating CRM software \n",
      "\t+ x.eye (www.xeye.com) and their wealth management software suite was selected over other applications including Siebel\n",
      "\t+ CRM software needed to adress relationship management and portfolio administration functions\n",
      "\t+ x.eye product suite has a one-way alerts via email functionality; no actionable alerts\n",
      "\t+ (see below for details)\n",
      "- Accenture is currently implementing x.eye at RBC\n",
      "- x.eye implementation is estimated to be completed in April\n",
      "\n",
      "Siebel at RBC Private Banking\n",
      "- Siebel is installed in the European offices of RBC Private Banking\n",
      "- There was no known Accenture involvement in this installation\n",
      "\n",
      "Jana at RBC Life Insurance\n",
      "- Accenture did an across the company assessement of CRM initiatives\n",
      "- RBC is a Jana customer for front-end CRM activity\n",
      "\t+ Jana was acquired by Siebel to fulfill Siebel front-end capabilities\n",
      "\t+ Siebel is in the process of fully integrating Jana into its product\n",
      "- Jana is being used by RBC as a customizable content management tool to attach to a backend Siebel database solution\n",
      "- Jana has been perceived by RBC as too customizable, causing back-end connection and reporting problems\n",
      "- Siebel and Jana integration at RBC is in future implementation plans\n",
      "- Accenture is not directly involved with the RBC Life Insurance group\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps\n",
      "Given the above information, we should be very clear internally on positioning our value proposition to the Accenture RBC client team and any subsequent RBC meetings that Accenture can arrange for us. My initial thoughts are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Verify with Accenture on how the RBC Investments group business processes can be streamlined with wireless in the context of this x.eye implementation\n",
      "- Create a story on how to wirelessly enable x.eye; refer to http://xeye.com/wealth_rela.html and their mention of Palm Pilots\n",
      "- Discuss with Accenture on perspectives on penetrating the other RBC divisions with Siebel initiatives\n",

      "Enjoyed talking to you today. As we mentioned in response to the RFP, our employee headcount is now approximately 96 which has come down successively from a high of 225 employees during Q1. Most of this reduction has taken place in US which has gone down from a peak of 180 employees to about 55 today. Here is how our monthly burn rate breaks down. All these numbers are approximate since I do not have the benefit of advice from our Director of Finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salary and benefits\t :  750k per month\n",
      "Facilities/travel/telecom   :  200k\n",
      "Other\t\t    \t :   50k\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Total monthly burn rate:  $1 million\t       \n",
      "\n",
      "On an average, the breakout of our headcount toward the burn rate calculation is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "US:  55 employees @ $10k :  $550k\n",
      "Japan: 6 employees @ $10k    $60k \n",
      "Canada: 15 employees@6k:    $90k\n",
      "India: 20 employees@ 2k    :    $40k\n",
      "Europe: 1 employee @10k        $10k\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, we  expect our burn rate to stay steady for this and the next two quarters. The current headcount is sufficient for us to take to a revenue run rate of $2.5 million by Q2 of next year from approximately $1.5 million this quarter. We expect to break-even by Q3 of next year at $3.3 million of revenue and burn rate. We still hope to have a sizeable cash balance in excess of $15 million at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe, compared to all our competitors who are already public, we have the best financial viability. Our revenues are growing significantly from quarter to quarter while we are managing our burn rate very aggressively. Although we do not see any need for it, we will be able to tap the private equity market further if we wanted additional capital.  None of our competitors that are already public can make this claim since their revenues are stagnant and burn rates are very high because their headcounts and fixed expenses are very high. Raising additional financing for companies that are already public and are not showing revenue growth will be problematic.\n",

      "Regarding AXA, we have been working with Julie Gordon, Director of Technical Services, Architecture & Standards.  She reports to Marvin Roufay.  In our discussions with Julie, she stated that AXA received budget approval last week for a global standardization of a mobile server platform.  She said that there were 10-11 internal projects that were on deck within various departments and there was a preference to standardize on one platform rather than manage multiple internal builds.  She is supposedly in charge of gathering the global requirements, issuing an RFP within 2-3 months and making a team recommendation to executive management.  They are looking at mobilizing a variety of business applications such as e-mail and SEBL CRM for a variety of devices - iPac, Jornada, Palm, RIM and 2 way pagers.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Talking points:\n",

      "Purpose of slide:  \n",

      "\t AvocadoIT connectors provide the ability “connect” to your enterprises existing infrastructure.  This is accomplished in a packaged AvocadoIT Connector for a specific application such as Siebel or SAP.  Using the AvocadoIT XML API you have the ability to connect to virtually any application or data source.\n",
      "\tThe AvocadoIT server performs the critical transaction, syncronization, data integrity and user session management between the mobile applications and your existing infrastructure.  In addition the AvocadoIT Server is a central, server based repository, for all of the mobile application logic.  \n",
      "\tThe AvocadoIT Smart Client runs on the device to manage synchronization, transaction and network connectivity to the AvocadoIT Server.  It also functions as a mini Web server that serves xHTML templates and populates them with data from XML data source.  Mobile applications run in the pocket IE browser on the device. \t\n",
      "\tApplication development and customization is performed in the AvocadoIT Studio or via any standards based 3rd party toolset such as Macromedia Dreamweaver or MS Frontpage.

      "How Safe Is the Business? Perception/Reality Disconnect. Our research indicates that a fundamental disconnect still exists between the business's perception of business continuity readiness and the IT organization's actual ability to deliver consistent, end-to-end recovery service. Recent META Group surveys indicate that most IT organizations lack continuity across the enterprise, are fundamentally infrastructure-focused (i.e., lack an end-to-end business perspective), are often underfunded and understaffed, and lack much of the critical expertise (both technical and business) needed to address a granular, business-driven continuity architecture. Indeed, our research shows that less than 25% of Global 2000 enterprises currently have comprehensive, effective enterprisewide business continuity/disaster recovery plans that are adequately documented and regularly and rigorously tested to meet the rapidly changing demands of the business.\n",

      "XRM: Extending the Relationship Management Portfolio Beyond the Customer. Organizations' relationship networks are expanding beyond customers to also include partners, employees, and suppliers. This leads to increased complexity and risk of relationship chaos. As a result, many organizations are creating an extended relationship management (XRM) strategy (2004/05) and treat their relationships as an XRM portfolio (e.g., channel partner, employee, customer, and supplier relationship management processes and products). To learn more about how your organization can leverage foundation relationship principles and business processes, listen to this audio briefing presented by META Group analysts Liz Shahnam and David Cearley and view the accompanying slides.\n",

      "Smart Moves With Smart Cards. Smart card deployments are approaching critical mass worldwide for specific government, banking, retail, and mobile needs. Enterprises intent on improving secure access to applications and other IT resources are seeking stronger forms of authentication than mere user IDs and passwords. Although several technology options exist, interest in the smart card as a mechanism for strong authentication has been rising. Invented in 1974, smart card deployments reached 500 million units in 2000; we project more than 1 billion units will exist by 2003. Smart card use is extensive for identification and verification services in European and Asian markets (primarily for SIM card use in the mobile phone market), with slower usage growth in the US. Increasing interest in using smart cards for authenticating access to applications (particularly in the e-business environment) is spurring intensive partnering and acquisition activity throughout the smart card manufacturing, reader, and application environments.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT has two adapters to integrate with Siebel\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT Siebel Wireless Adapter uses the WML pages as a datasource.\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel accesses Siebel business components via Java Data Beans (JDB).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To meet Biogen’s requirements, AvocadoIT recommended the AvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel, which uses Java Data Beans to interface with Siebel ePharma.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT recommended the AvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel to Biogen based on multiple factors.  We found that accessing the Siebel Business Components directly was much more efficient than transacting with Siebel Wireless’ UI layer.  Also, specific data to enable features like conflict detection and resolution is available from Business Components, but is not available from the Siebel Wireless Application.  Using the AvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel reduces synchronization time, improves the user experience, and increases customer satisfaction.  The details of Biogen’s requirements and issues associated with both adapters are summarized below. \n",

      "\tRequirement\n",
      "\tAvocadoIT Siebel Wireless Adapter\n",
      "\tAvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel\n",
      "\n",
      "\tApplication Performance\n",
      "\tThe UI of the WML app was optimized for user interaction on a phone and is therefore sub-optimized for use as a data source for another application. Synchronization could take several minutes because screens in the WML application need to be traversed.  \n",
      "\tThe Siebel Business Components are accessed directly.  Synchronization with a comparable amount of data is faster because we are not constrained by the way data is presented for UI purposes.  In one test scenario, data downloads from Siebel Wireless took 3-4 minutes. Downloading the same amount of data using the Java Data Beans took less than a minute.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tConflict Resolution\n",
      "\tThere is no information about the last time a specific record was updated within the output of Siebel Wireless.  Conflict resolution cannot occur because there are no timestamps.\n",
      "\tTimestamp information is available from the Siebel Business Component, which is accessed via JDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "�\n",
      "\n",
      "\t“Delta” Downloads\n",
      "\n",
      "(downloading just a subset of data that changed since the last download.)\n",
      "\tSiebel Wireless does not provide a mechanism for downloading data that has changed since the last time the device accessed Siebel. Therefore, all records must be downloaded from Siebel Wireless during every synchronization.  This increases the time for every synchronization.\n",
      "\tWith Java Data Beans, a filter can be used to retrieve only the records that have changed since the last download.  For example, a search criterion can be used on the “Updated” field. This lets the user download only the data that has changed and improves the performance of subsequent downloads substantially.  For example, after the first download, subsequent downloads may take less time to complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tSelective Downloads\n",
      "\t“Selective Download” presumes you can efficiently search and retrieve records based on a pattern match.  To implement using Siebel Wireless, AvocadoIT software would have to retrieve all records and then parse through them to return search results.  This would mean that we would have to replicate business logic to compare, search, and sort Siebel data types, e.g., dates, addresses, etc.\n",
      "\tThe Java Data Bean approach leverages Siebel’s search capabilities (query, sorts, etc).  Siebel returns only the records that match a search criterion.  For example, “All accounts that are in zip code 0704*” where “*” is a wildcard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tSiebel ePharma\n",
      "\tSiebel Wireless not readily available for Biogen because they are firmly committed to v6.3\n",
      "\tUsing JDB’s, the AvocadoIT Business Component Adapter can access any Siebel Business Component\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Siebel Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "The AvocadoIT Siebel Wireless Adapter has been validated by Siebel.  AvocadoIT has submitted the AvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel for official validation.  The validation process is dependent on mutually available resources from both Siebel and AvocadoIT.  However, the AvocadoIT Business Components Adapter for Siebel is a working product today.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sage has approached the monopolies commission in Denmark, the home of Navision, and plans to approach the commissions in other key countries in an attempt to prevent Microsoft's acquisition of Navision. Sage claims that it is happy to compete with Navision in the Danish market and that the products from either company only have a 3% market segment overlap at the top of Sage's market. Sage also claims that the pending acquisition enables Microsoft to bundle its existing products with those of Navision and flood the market at a much reduced price.  Heinz Gras, a spokesman at Microsoft said, \"The business applications market for small and midsize companies has great potential growth opportunity for many companies. Microsoft's investment in this space will help create new opportunity for software and IT services to bring high value offerings to customers and for our partners to deliver additional products and solutions to these small and midmarket customers.\" He added, \" The business applications segment is highly competitive both in Europe and in the United States. Navision and Microsoft are looking forward to competing based on the merits of our combined expertise to bring great products and services to market that meet the needs of small and midmarket customers around the world.\"  Microsoft also commented that it is confident that the acquisition is in full compliance with EU law-including in Denmark-and it looks forward to completing the deal as anticipated this summer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sage has little presence in Denmark and claims that the combined companies would close off the market. It will also make the same representation in other countries. Assuming that this is the extent of Sage's gripe, it is unlikely that the monopolies authorities would uphold the claim. Indeed, the same argument could be made against Sage and its partner IBM, given IBM's enormous presence in the Danish market.  Sage also did much the same thing following its acquisition of Tetra. Sage brought two highly competitively priced products to market in order to address the small to medium market and soon dominated. It's a storm in an herbal teacup. \n",

      "MRO Aims To Put the Enterprise in EAM With MainControl Purchase \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "MRO Software acquired IT asset management vendor MainControl.  MRO will integrate MainControl's application into Maximo, MRO's core Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) product.  The move gives MRO a product suite capable of managing assets across the entire user enterprise. \n",
      "\n",
      "The acquisition is a win for MainControl customers since MRO, as measured by sales, is five-times larger than MainControl.  Users will benefit from the MainControl product being part of the MRO suite, and as a critical component to MRO's growth, MainControl will have its share of allocated research and development funds.  While Peregrine dominates the IT asset management market, companies like MainControl and STI Software lived well on their slices.  The acquisition will give MainControl the opportunity to go stronger against Peregrine's dominance. \n",
      "\n",
      "The acquisition mirrors a strategy that Peregrine has embarked upon, but from the other direction.  Peregrine, taking a more difficult path, is coming from IT asset management upstream to complex asset management.  Marrying the management of assets across an enterprise is difficult because the requirements for managing IT assets are significantly different from production assets.  For integration, MRO is looking more at development of the data model and less at architecture because of the similarities between the two products.  The consolidated application should let clients look at the costs and inventory of all physical assets. \n",
      "\n",
      "The real test is determining exactly how a CFO, who would be the one most interested in the combined product, will see the use of the application.  For the software to be useful to a CFO, it needs to not only manage the daily status of assets, but also handle capital planning, lifecycle cost estimation, and disposition of assets.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ascential Software bought data quality vendor Vality for $92M.  The purchase will let Ascential, with software that moves and translates big blocks of data from operational systems to data warehouses, add Vality's system, which cleans up source data by removing things like duplicate customer records (for example, it would automatically figure that J. Ramstein, Jr. is the same as John Ramstein, Jr.) \n",
      "\n",
      "One conglomerate we spoke with used Vality to develop a single master customer list from 60 operating company supplier lists.  It saved millions because it knew exactly how much it was buying from each supplier and could leverage this information for volume discounts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Independent data quality vendors are becoming a rare breed; Trillium is one of the few large independents left.  This is a welcome development for end users that are weary of dealing with three or four vendors for integration.  Point integration systems in Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL), Web services, data quality, and the like are all an integration hassle themselves.  Ascential's offering and SAS's recent combination of ETL and data quality are excellent first steps in the creation of a complete integration engine.  We look forward to more.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Encountering truly satisfied users of a software application is rare.  However, MindFlow Technologies' five reference accounts from the Food Service and Process Manufacturing industries have all been resoundingly positive about the vendor.  Food service and consumer products companies continually struggle with centralization and optimization of sourcing operations; they need to juggle thousands of complex relationships while simultaneously controlling costs in a highly competitive and cost-sensitive market.  MindFlow's products are designed to give them a way to better manage such a juggling act. \n",
      "\n",
      "Users universally reported that MindFlow allowed them to blow past cost savings targets within days or weeks of going live.  Cost savings resulted from centralizing corporate purchasing, using auction and reverse auctioning tools to lower product costs, and optimizing ship-to and ship-from decisions.  The re-allocation of employees from tactical data manipulation to identifying new sourcing opportunities generated less tangible but equally valuable results.  Users also consistently reported implementation times of two to eight weeks and payback periods as short at six weeks.  In one case, the MindFlow project paid for itself entirely before the system made it out of the pilot phase. \n",
      "\n",
      "MindFlow does have room for improvement; spend analysis, sourcing compliance, and key performance indicator tracking are all areas targeted for enhancement in the ProcureMind's version 4.0, which is due out in July.  But the company has clearly established the all-important set of referenceable customers.  Further analysis of MindFlow and its competitors will be published in our strategic sourcing applications ranking report due in May 2002.\n",

      "\n",
      "Further to our conversation on Biogen, I wanted to provide you clarifications regarding the key differences between AvocadoIT and AvantGo as well as the AvocadoIT approach to integrating with Siebel. Details are in the attached Word docs. I would appreciate it if you could forward them to Shawn Roman and Grant Andes with your comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding AvocadoIT integration with Siebel, I wanted to make it clear that we support all types of integration with Siebel modules. If Biogen is evaluating a Siebel Wireless approach, we provide an AvocadoIT Siebel Wireless adapter that uses WML pages as datasource. This approach is officially validated by Siebel.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if the client is evaluating integrating with Siebel Business Components (preferred approach), then we provide an AvocadoIT Business Components adapter that accesses Siebel Business Components via Java Data Beans. Our demo application for Biogen (mobilizing ePharma) is built using this approach and the application performance is excellent. We have talked to Siebel regarding this approach and they are fine with it. AvocadoIT will shortly be submitting its Business Components adapter to Siebel for official validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom, I appreciate all your help on this one. As you well know, Biogen is a key Siebel prospect for the company. Not only are we committed to winning this bid, we will also provide all the R&D and support resources necessary to make this a successful implementation for Biogen and Accenture. This is a success that I believe can easily be replicated within a short period of time across Accenture's other Pharma clients as well as cross-market unit clients, including those in Communications and Financial Services.\n",

      "\n",
      "Congress has established a 5-percent government-wide goal for awards\n",
      "to woman-owned small businesses (WOSBs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet year after year, federal agencies fail to meet this goal.  In\n",

      "contracting dollars to WOSBs--only HALF the stated goal!\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent survey, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) surveyed\n",
      "procurement officials and women-owned business owners to find out\n",
      "what the problem is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report concluded: \"Government contracting officials at all levels\n",
      "told us that they were generally overwhelmed by the number and\n",
      "complexity of the requirements of small business contracting programs\n",
      "and their related goals.  These officials believe that the programs\n",

      "this program should, in theory, help contracting officers reach out\n",
      "to women-owned small businesses, the reports suggests that the large\n",
      "number of small business programs diverts attention from women-owned\n",
      "goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly another problem is that, while the program has a required\n",

      "The upside, though, is this: because there's no such thing as a WOSB\n",

      "This email is in response to your request for information on AvocadoIT's mobile solutions. On behalf of David Meltzer, we would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you earlier this week regarding GE Capital's wireless initiatives and for spending time with us at the recent Sun Wireless event.  I am the Sales Director for the northeast, based in Boston, and have overall responsibility for General Electric.  I wanted to take a moment to further introduce AvocadoIT to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "AvocadoIT is the leading software platform and services provider that offers Enterprises a secure and scalable mobile solution.  Unlike any other approach, AvocadoIT's Intelligent Rendering technology leverages existing application infrastructure, providing clients a time to market advantage and enabling the integration of future devices, protocols and networks into their mobile strategy.   As a result, we offer one of the best means to present customers' applications on the broadest range of devices, including RIM 2-way pagers, Palm, PocketPCs, WAP Phones (both HDML and WML), and even Interactive TV. In addition, we offer voice capabilities so that a regular telephone becomes a supported \"device\". \n",
      "\n",
      "We have recently added modules to our architecture to offer offline application interaction so that customers can interact with the application even when there is no wireless signal, actionable alerts, and location-based services.   Our solution is extremely robust and enables you to aggregate disparate data and applications, such as Siebel, Web sites, and data bases on your backend into a single mobile application.  This unique capability allows you to combine components of an SFA, ERP, and a CRM application, for example, to create a custom mobile solution that adds value and enhanced productivity to a mobile force.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To date, over 60 customers and partners have selected AvocadoIT including E*TRADE, E*TRADE Bank, Fidelity, Paytrust, Alaska Airlines, America West Airlines, and Salesforce.com. Our software has been \"battle-tested\" in an ASP environment for over two years.  AvocadoIT also provides a software license model for those companies that wish to do their own development and require the server to be located behind their firewall.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also signed strategic alliances with industry leaders such as Accenture, formerly known as Andersen Consulting, CG Ernst & Young (CGE&Y), Sun, and Hewlett Packard. These are significant co-development and go-to-market alliances. For example, Accenture and Sun have made strategic and equity investments in AvocadoIT. In addition, Accenture is co-developing their Mobile Corporate Portal product utilizing AvocadoIT technology and CGE&Y is building an \"AvocadoIT Practice\" staffed with dedicated consultants.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a next step, I will contact you within the week to arrange a meeting with you and your team to discuss GE Capital's critical business issues that a wireless mobile solution from AvocadoIT will address.  In the interim, I have enclosed a brochure on AvocadoIT for your review and invite you to visit our website at www.avocadoit.com.  I look forward to speaking with you soon.\n",

If it will not meet his needs, he will let us know what can be done to make it work for Arizona. We will then assess accordingly. Tim is also looking into the detailed business numbers for the Arizona opportunity so that I can make a better business case for him internally.\n",

The interpretation of my news today will need to be managed. We will need to communicate to Accenture our product milestones for Q1 2002 soon to clarify our position even more.

While we have been competing effectively on the Biogen deal, it is not won.  Furthermore, as we commit time and resources outside of Biogen we need to keep focused on generating and qualifying new opportunities that meet our target criteria.  90% of our time should be dedicated to our efforts in this area.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's official: Microsoft is buying low-end Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor Navision for $1.33B. The purchase, coming after Microsoft bought Great Plains for $1.1B in 2000, is intended to fuel growth from within the small to midsize business applications market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst there have been discussions around the integration and rationalisation of the two suites, AMR Research expects co-habitation for some time, well beyond the six weeks to four months the deal is expected to take to close. Geographically, the purchase complements Microsoft's plans, with Great Plains being strongly U.S.-centric and Navision strongly European. Navision brings manufacturing and supply chain expertise in addition to financials that it has in common with Great Plains. It also brings localisation skills that will be crucial to exploit if the model will scale as intended. Most of the 1,400 Navision staff members will likely be retained. \n",
      "\n",
      "The brand strength and marketing dollars of Microsoft will be significant, but the real difficulty will be how Microsoft can manage to further package and commoditise certain parts of the overall portfolio to accelerate adoption through a high-volume, low-cost channel. It's not as easy as it may initially appear, and NET may end up playing a role over time. With SAP's recent purchase of TopManage, the market for small to midsize systems is set for further consolidation and turmoil.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Groove from Groove Networks offers shared workspaces to teams collaborating either in real time or via synchronisation when one or more members has worked offline. A workspace comprises a set of software tools chosen by each team for suitability to the team's activities, and of course, the workspace includes the information that the team shares. Tools might be very generic, like drawing boards and discussion forums, or they might be very project-specific, like account management or proposal production tools. \n",
      "\n",
      "MindManager from Mindjet provides a personal and collaborative tool in the form of electronic mindmaps that can be used to shape ideas, brainstorm, refine topics, and share the results in a readily understandable form. Consequently, mindmaps fit the role of team tool very well, and this week's announcement of a MindManager tool for Groove 2.0 is therefore excellent news. There's yet more synergy in that: \n",
      "\n",
      "*\tboth companies recognise that their products suit project teams and therefore market to this community (although they have very wide applicability outside this field, too) \n",
      "*\tboth grow user numbers through personal recommendation and easy download of limited software versions, so they're accustomed to viral marketing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Groove has a very distinctive user interface and its own information storage, hyperlinking, and change notification conventions, which Mindjet must accommodate if its use is to be seamless within Groove. It would also help if both products made fewer demands on users' PCs, but any limitations here can be checked by downloading the products and trying them. In fact, this is the best way to grasp what these products can achieve for you, your projects, and your company.\n",

The terms and conditions of this PSA are subordinate to, and additional to, the terms and conditions of the MA.  The MA and this PSA will govern AvocadoIT’s provision of all Professional Services.  The parties agree:\n",

      "1.2\t“Acceptance” means Customer’s acceptance of the Application(s) as specified in Section 5.\n",
      "1.3\t“Application Maintenance Services” mean the Professional Services required to modify an Application pursuant to a Change Order that occurs after its Acceptance.\n",
      "1.4\t“Change Order” means any written change order prepared by AvocadoIT and executed by Customer that specifies the Professional Services required to effect modifications to an Application required by (i) a Source Change, or (ii) (i) additional and/or alternative requirements that are submitted by Customer.\n",

      "1.6\t“Monthly Services Allowance” means the number of hours per month of Application Maintenance Services specified in a SOW or Change Order that will be provided by AvocadoIT to Customer at no additional charge subject to Customer’s timely payment of Fees.\n",
      "1.7\t“Project(s)” mean the development project(s) that are based on the Specifications and detailed in a SOW or Change Order, each of which will result in the delivery by AvocadoIT to Customer of a new, or a modified, Application.\n",
      "1.8\t “Specification” means Customer’s instructions to AvocadoIT detailing Customer’s requirements for the Application(s).\n",
      "2.0\tQuestion: Which one of these documents needs to describe our ‘Premium Service’ offering?  For example some premium customers have been provided a staging server on which we or the customer can access their mobilized application receiving a feed from their development/staging webserver.\n",
      "2.0\tPROVISION OF THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES\n",
      "2.1\tBased on a Specification, the Project Manager will prepare a SOW or Change Order.\n",
      "2.2\tAvocadoIT will solely determine the manner in which the Professional Services are performed.\n",
      "2.3\tAll Customer inquiries or requests will be directed to the Project Manager.  \n",
      "3.0\tSPECIFICATION CHANGES\n",
      "3.1\tCustomer will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify AvocadoIT’s Project Manager prior to any specification change.   AvocadoIT will inform Customer whether or not an anticipated Source Change is likely to impact the delivery schedule or require a separate Change Order. \n",
      "3.2\tIf AvocadoIT notifies Customer that a specification change requires the preparation, execution and implementation of a new SOW or Change Order in order to deliver or maintain an Application, AvocadoIT will, upon Customer’s request, provide Customer with the detailed description of the Professional Services required.\n",
      "3.3\tAvocadoIT will commence the Professional Services specified in a Change Order or SOW only after Customer approval.   \n",
      "4.0\tAPPLICATION MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND THE MONTHLY SERVICES ALLOWANCE\n",
      "4.1\tThe Monthly Services Allowance may be credited against Application Maintenance Services only. \n",
      "4.2\tThe Monthly Services Allowance will not be used to perform Professional Services required because of (i) new or additional features or functionality Customer requests, or (ii) a new SOW.\n",
      "4.3\tAny unused portion of the Monthly Services Allowance expires at the end of each calendar month.\n",
      "4.4\tSubject to timely payment of all Fees, AvocadoIT will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform additional Application Maintenance Services upon Customer’s request.  \n",
      "5.0\tACCEPTANCE AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA\n",
      "5.1\tUpon its completion of the applicable Professional Services, AvocadoIT will advise Customer in writing (“Notice of Completion”) that the Application is performing substantially in conformity to the applicable specification.  \n",

      "5.3\tUnless Customer provides AvocadoIT a reasonably detailed, written notice (pursuant to Section 11.1 of the MA) that describes any non-conformities from the applicable specification that Customer finds after testing the Application pursuant to Section 5.2 so AvocadoIT can reproduce such non-conformities (the “Deficiency Notice”) within five days of the date of the Notice of Completion, “Acceptance” of the Application will be deemed to occur upon the fifth business day (the “Acceptance Date”) after the date of such Notice of Completion.\n",
      "5.4\tIn the event that Customer does provide AvocadoIT a Deficiency Notice as specified in Section 5.3, AvocadoIT will use commercially reasonable efforts and Customer will cooperate fully with its efforts, to revise the Application within 5 business days so that such Application performs in substantial conformity to the applicable specification.  AvocadoIT will again provide a Notice of Completion pursuant to Section 5.1 and Customer will again test and approve or disapprove such revised Application pursuant to Section 5.2.\n",
      "5.5\tIn the event that Acceptance has not occurred after such efforts, subject to Customer’s compliance with Section 7, the applicable Project will be deemed terminated and additional Fees will not accrue for such Project. \n",
      "6.0\tINVOICES\n",
      "6.1\tAll invoices will be submitted to the Customer contact and address specified in Exhibit A.\n",
      "7.0\tCUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS\n",
      "\t7.1\tIf at any time, AvocadoIT’s performance of any scheduled Professional Services is delayed because of Customer’s failure to fulfill its obligations under this PSA, any SOW, Change Order or otherwise, or because Customer fails to provide any required deliverable in accordance with the mutually agreed upon timeline specified in any Agreement, project plan, specification or any other document except if any such failure or delay is the result of an act or omission of AvocadoIT, then (i) AvocadoIT will maintain the availability of the required staffing for the Project unless and until Customer provides AvocadoIT written notice that AvocadoIT may reassign its employees, (ii) Customer will be billed monthly at the ‘Daily Staffing Rate’ specified in the applicable SOW or Change Order, and (iii) Customer will be invoiced such amount as a separate item outside of the payment schedule specified in the applicable SOW or Change Order.  However, after 14 days AvocadoIT will reassign its employees and will invoice Customer for, and Customer will be liable for, 100% of the Application Development Fees applicable to such Project.\n",

      "\n",
      "Biogen, Inc., winner of the U.S. National Medal of Technology, is a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing drugs for human health care. Headquartered in Cambridge, MA, the company’s revenues are generated from worldwide sales of AVONEX( (Interferon beta-1a) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), and from sales by its licensees of a number of products, including alpha interferon, hepatitis B vaccines and hepatitis B diagnostic products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biogen recently completed dosing all patients in its Phase III trials of AMEVIVE™ (alefacept) in chronic plaque psoriasis and expects to have data from these trials by mid-year 2001.  Pending successful conclusion of the trials, Biogen anticipates product registration and launch in the second half of 2002.  The psoriasis marketplace has many parallels to the MS marketplace in 1996 when Biogen launched AVONEX( – a large, underserved patient population and a medical community that is close-knit and tightly focused.  Biogen plans to register and launch concurrently throughout the world, thus capturing maximum value for the drug – just as with AVONEX(.  Biogen has had much experience with this business model and anticipates equal success in the psoriasis marketplace as was achieved in the neurology marketplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biogen is also collaborating with Elan Pharmaceuticals on Antegren(, a second drug to treat multiple sclerosis as well as Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract. Biogen and Elan recently announced positive results from preliminary analyses of two large Phase II clinical studies with Antegren( for both of these diseases.  Phase III studies are being initiated in 2001.\n",

The key components of the mobile solution  include Contacts (Professionals), Accounts, Call Execution, Activity History, Calendar, and email.

Additionally, there are several Associate Sales Representatives (ASRs) that share territories with some of the ABMs.  ABMs typically make office visits and target Neurologists.  There are approximately 16,000 physicians who have prescribed Avonex( or one of our competitor’s products.  However, of the 8000 neurologists in the U.S., 4000 neurologists treat the majority of people with MS.  Neurologists are typically found in individual or group practices, and MS Clinics.  ABMs also work closely with the local and national MS Societies in their areas.  The ABMs do not currently sample Avonex( and there are no plans to sample Amevive( since they are both injectable drugs.\n",

The NAMs work closely with the Managed Care Organizations, Wholesalers, and large pharmacy chains to enhance the reimbursement formulary position for Avonex.  Additionally, there are medical professionals that provide medical and clinical support to the ABMs and our customers.\n",

      "The European sales force is similar in size to U.S.  The sales force consists of Regional Directors, ABMs, and Key Account Managers who handle the larger MS Clinics and Centers.

      "Starting the CRM Process: Examples From the Field. Our research indicates that more than 80% of customer relationship management (CRM) programs are initially run as ad hoc \"skunkworks\" operations rather than formally constructed corporate initiatives. Although optimized CRM programs adopt structured top-down approaches (e.g., CRM METAmethod), most companies are required (because of absent budget, sponsorship, or interest) to pursue gradualist bottom-up \"guerrilla\" CRM (gCRM), incrementally building improved corporate CRM initiatives. We have identified several project-driven tactical approaches for driving CRM initiatives. IT and business managers should identify which tactical measures have worked in their own organizations and use these as templates for building successful CRM projects and programs.\n",

      "Consolidating Unstructured Applications: A 12-Step Program. As the volume of unstructured content continues to grow, many organizations are incurring high ongoing costs to support applications from multiple vendors for managing this content. META Group recommends that organizations assess their current unstructured applications in the context of current/future business and technical requirements to determine where cost savings and practical consolidation can be achieved. This technology sector has entered a period of rapid advances (2001-05) that will offer opportunities for cost savings and functional benefits if users can exploit the rapid evolution (i.e., portals as the dominant presentation layer, enterprise content management consolidating content services, and traditional database vendors transitioning into unstructured repository vendors).\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     Getting any required agreement from USPS to use that application (zip\n",
      "     code finder, post office locator, package tracking) at PostEXPO\n",
      "     Getting agreement for access to the USPS website to extract actual\n",
      "     data, or to generate realistic sample data\n",
      "     What technical environment we need to make all this fly (preferably\n",
      "     self-contained, as the reliability of the ISDN lines at PostEXPO is\n",
      "     not ideal)\n",
      "\n",
      "If we cannot get USPS agreement, we thought that the fallback should be a\n",
      "package tracking demo, where we would need to mock up a website from which\n",
      "data could be downloaded.  Any comments?     I will check to see if we can\n",
      "get USPS approval to demo the wireless capability you have discussed at the\n",
      "PostEXPO.  If we get approval there are a couple of ways you can demo the\n",
      "functionality.  One on an emulator that runs on a laptop.  This emulator\n",
      "would have to be connected to the internet which would use the USPS.com\n",
      "website to bring back results.  The other possibility is to create a self\n",
      "contained PQA that would run on a Palm device or Palm Emulator.  This PQA\n",
      "would have hardcoded data in it and would not need to be connected to the\n",
      "internet or a signal.  This would allow the capability to be demoed\n",
      "anywhere,  it would not actually be wireless or connected to USPS.com.\n",
      "This method would greatly reduce the risk of technical difficulties during\n",
      "the EXPO.  The real question is do you want to demo on a Palm or other\n",
      "device.  If another device is the preference then we should talk about how\n",
      "to best support that in a self contained manner.\n",
      "My impression is that for European audiences, phones are more relevant than\n",
      "Palm devices.  JRC\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  I understand from the note from Ty Wang which Dave forwarded that a\n",
      "proof-of-concept to link mobile devices to Siebel has been developed.  We\n",
      "decided earlier to defer a Wireless Scenario to Release 2 of our Postal\n",
      "Siebel demo.  Julie - is this still the right decision?  I don't think it\n",
      "is realistic to incorporate wireless into the current configuration of the\n",
      "Siebel postal demo.  We don't have a license key for it, and the current\n",
      "version of Siebel only works with Windows CE devices.  A proof of concept\n",
      "version would add more risk to the overall architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we have in the demo now is fairly realistic for a Post to implement\n",
      "quickly in a pilot.  As we discussed in our call this week, the current\n",
      "demo functionality is \"CRM Fundamentals\", getting a Post started.  Wireless\n",
      "would be a later phase for the Post.  However, the wireless functionality\n",
      "from AvocadoIT for mobile carriers would support a scenario similiar to\n",
      "what David was describing, i.e. problems for a residential (or home office)\n",
      "customer with deliveries, etc.\n",

      "Earlier we discussed with Tim an option where we could dummy up screens to\n",
      "look like a Siebel wireless application, and run those on a wireless\n",
      "device, without connectivity to the demo laptop.  That can be independent\n",
      "of our Siebel postal demo as it is currently configured.  We could develop\n",
      "dummy screens that have the same accounts and contacts that are in the\n",
      "Siebel demo.  To do this, we would need to design screens based on the\n",
      "Siebel wireless interface (we don't currently have documentation from\n",
      "Siebel), and Tim's group would develop the wireless part.   I believe this\n",

      "\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "\n",
      "Per our action item this morning, Ray and I met with Amitabh to review the technical requirements for Biogen.  We have the following questions that need to be answered by Biogen and/or Accenture.  Following our discussions with Biogen/Accenture, we can assess the technical qualification for this opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ty & Amit - How quickly do you think you tee this up with Shawn Roman and/or the Biogen IT contact?  We need these answers back before we can complete a meaningful response to the RFI.  We're continuing with the RFI response process, but this has become the critical path.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Is it Biogen's preference to sync to Siebel at the HQ server or to the client software on the sales rep's laptop?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our recommendation would be to sync the PDA to the server directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their diagram looks like they are sync'ing to the laptop.  This introduces a number of issues that work to their disadvantage (and ours).  For example, this means that data is sync'ed between the PDA and the laptop client PLUS data is sync'ed between the laptop client and the server.  This creates an undesireable data conflict resolution scenario.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It would be interesting to know if AvantGo influenced this architecture.  Or, could it be that Accenture designed this architecture for Biogen because they didn't know better?  We need to know so that we we can influence the final architecture.  Although it seems like a stretch, perhaps we could persuade them to use the PDA as their primary Siebel access device instead of the laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Is it Biogen's preference to integrate their mobile app with Lotus Notes directly or through Siebel?  What parts of Notes are they integrating with Siebel (PIM, e-mail, DB)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Their architecture diagram shows that Notes is tied to Siebel's App Server.  There are pro's and con's to both approaches, but it would be good for us to know what they were thinking when they drew the diagram the way they did.  On one hand, if they tie Notes to Siebel directly, then we don't have to worry about mobilizing Notes because all the data would come through Siebel.  On the other hand, Siebel may not be able to present all the Notes functionality that they want.  For example, their demo scenario slide indicates that e-mail, address book, and calendar are \"Additional Needs/Capabilities\".  How do we prioritize that?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. What's the value of wireless to Biogen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wireless / Real-time is not called out specifically in the RFI.  At this point, we can only speculate and hypothesize why they should buy wireless in addition to cradle-sync.  We need to dialoge with Biogen to see if this is jsut a \"nice to have\" or if they have a specific scenario in mind.  Perhaps they really do want wireless and AvantGo talked them out of it because they couldn't deliver a compelling solution.  Even though Shawn Roman (Accenture) indicated that wireless was a secondary requirement, we owe it to ourselves to confirm that with Biogen directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, rather than responding to this RFP blindly, we would benefit from engaging the decision makers to understand the context of these requirements.  This also gives us a reason to front of them and start building a relationship with the buyers.  Right now,  to Biogen we're an unknown vendor without a face.\n",

In planning each call, basic objectives for the call are entered as a reminder of the key messages to be delivered during the call.  These objectives are based on prior interactions with the doctor and overall sales and marketing objectives.  Prior to leaving for the day, the ABM synchronizes the PDA with the laptop.  \n",
      "Prior to interacting with the Physician, the ABM accesses the Physician information and reviews the objectives for the call.  After the interaction, the ABM captures the key messages delivered, any promotional items distributed, sales objections raised by the physician and brief notes about the call.  The ABM also identifies opportunities for the Medical Liaison to work with this Physician on a particular medical program.  The ABM needs to send notification of next steps and/or tasks to the Regional Director and Medical Liaison.  \n",

      "We begin with electronic signatures because it's an e-procurement \n",

      "make e-procurement possible.  Any vendor involved in e-procurement will be \n",
      "operating under the blessing of one or more electronic signature laws. \n",
      " \n",
      "* GOVERNMENT E-PROCUREMENT PUSH *\n",
      "\n",
      "To compete for government business, vendors are finding themselves \n",
      "involved in e-procurement.  More and more, they're finding that at least \n",
      "some sales activities MUST be conducted online.  Examples of online \n",
      "activity include responding to RFPs, displaying catalogs, and even \n",
      "executing contracts. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the federal level, the primary source behind this e-procurement push \n",
      "is Section 30 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act, \n",
      "which requires that a federal procurement organization \"establish, \n",
      "maintain, and use, to the maximum extent that is practicable and cost-\n",
      "effective, procedures and processes that employ electronic commerce in \n",
      "the conduct and administration of its procurement system.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "In line with this law, traditional Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \n",
      "definitions have been expanded to include the use of e-commerce and \n",
      "electronic signatures.  For example, \"contract\" includes \"all types of \n",
      "commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated \n",
      "funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing.\"  The FAR \n",
      "also makes it clear that \"in writing,\" \"writing\" and \"written\" refer to \n",
      "\"any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and \n",
      "later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored \n",
      "information.\"  Furthermore, the FAR states that electronic commerce \"may \n",
      "be used to issue RFPs and to receive proposals, modifications, and \n",
      "revisions,\" and that an \"electronic signature may be used in the \n",
      "production of purchase orders by automated methods.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "Under the authority of these legislative and regulatory changes, agencies \n",
      "are moving their procurement activities online, forcing vendors to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"ELECTRONIC\" VS. \"DIGITAL\" SIGNATURES * \n",
      "\n",
      "To encourage the use of e-commerce the federal government wanted to make \n",
      "it clear that e-signatures are valid in executing contracts.  What do we \n",
      "mean by e-signatures?  Let's consider two important definitions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Electronic signature\" is a general term that refers to signatures created \n",
      "using a variety of possible cryptographic methods.  Signatures often are \n",
      "accomplished through the use of username and passwords, or PIN numbers.  \n",
      "\"Electronic\" signatures are less secure than \"digital\" in terms user \n",
      "authentication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Digital signature\" is a more specific term (and a subset of \"electronic \n",
      "signature\") that refers to signatures created with public key cryptosystems.  \n",
      "Signatures are accomplished through Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  With \n",
      "digital signatures there is true authentication that the person signing \n",
      "is who he says he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary federal and state laws in this area, ESIGN and UETA, are based \n",
      "on the looser \"electronic signature\" requirement. \n",
      "\n",
      "* E-SIGNATURE LAWS * \n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Law: Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \n",
      "(ESIGN)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) \n",
      "expressly authorizes the use of electronic signatures, notarizations, \n",
      "acknowledgments and verifications, and electronic records.  Under the act, \n",
      "no contract, signature or record can be denied legal effect solely because \n",
      "it's in electronic form.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The law is rather general, saying essentially that electronic signatures \n",
      "may be used to establish binding contracts.  ESIGN also states that a \n",
      "person cannot be required to agree to use or accept electronic records or \n",
      "electronic signatures.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Federal agencies, however, are the glaring exception to this rule.  Section \n",
      "101(b)(2) states that the act does not obligate any person \"other than a \n",
      "governmental agency with respect to a record other than a contract to which \n",
      "it is a party.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are two competing interpretations of this important provision.  The \n",
      "Office of Management and Budget's position on section 101(b)(2) is that it \n",
      "applies broadly to an entire transaction involving a government contract, \n",
      "including all records RELATING TO the contract.  Under OMB's interpretation, \n",
      "federal contracting officers can disallow all electronic responses.   \n",
      "\n",
      "A second interpretation holds that section 101(b)(2) does not apply to \n",
      "documents in the procurement process that come BEFORE the actual contract \n",
      "(e.g., contractor requests for clarification, statements of interest, \n",
      "and proposals).  Federal contracting officers under this interpretation \n",
      "could not, for example, exclude an offeror from consideration solely on \n",
      "the grounds that it submitted its proposal electronically. \n",
      "\n",
      "This second interpretation seems most logical in light of the plain \n",
      "language of the statute.  The issue, however, has yet to be decided by a \n",
      "federal court.  In practice, many federal agencies still insist on \n",
      "receiving paper responses to solicitations, and, until a court says \n",
      "otherwise, contracting officers can point to OMB's position for support.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a vendor, when would it make sense for you to insist on an electronic \n",
      "response when the solicitation calls for paper?  When your interest in \n",
      "statutory interpretation outweighs your interest in winning government \n",
      "business.  In other words, probably never.\n",
      "\n",
      "State Laws: Two Approaches \n",
      "\n",
      "The states have adopted two general approaches in authorizing the use of \n",
      "electronic signatures: (1) only digital signatures satisfy signature \n",
      "requirements (Utah approach); and (2) electronic signatures satisfy legal \n",
      "signature requirements (UETA approach). \n",
      "\n",
      "1) Utah Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "States following the first approach authorize the use of only digital \n",
      "signatures, ignoring the more general category of electronic signatures.  \n",
      "Utah was the first state to adopt such legislation, sometimes referred to \n",
      "as \"long statutes.\"  Long statutes recognize digital signatures as legally \n",
      "binding but go beyond that by giving digital records evidentiary weight, \n",
      "adopting a specific technology (usually asymmetric cryptosystem), \n",
      "allocating liability, and providing a state's Secretary of State (or \n",
      "other public entity) extensive regulatory powers.   \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "The second approach is more in line with traditional contract law, under \n",
      "which almost anything can qualify as a signature.  (Over the years courts \n",
      "have deemed a variety of non-ink-and-paper methods valid signatures: \n",
      "names on telegrams, typed names, names on letterhead, and faxed signatures, \n",
      "for example.)   \n",
      "\n",
      "States following this approach separate the issue of signature from the \n",
      "issues of security, proof and evidence.  These states have adopted, in \n",
      "whole or in part, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), which \n",
      "is similar to the federal act, ESIGN.  As of July 18, 2001, 37 states had \n",
      "passed various versions of the UETA.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* PRACTICAL EFFECT * \n",
      "\n",
      "When joining government-backed e-procurement systems, you may find \n",
      "yourself operating under one or both of these approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Systems operating under the Utah approach will be more secure.  On the \n",
      "other hand, such systems may require that you install and learn to use \n",
      "PKI software.\n",
      "\n",
      "While systems operating under the UETA approach will be less secure, the \n",
      "benefit is that you won't have to hassle with PKI software.  Basically, \n",
      "you'll just have to register with the system (acknowledging, among other \n",
      "things, that you have agent authority to represent your company), choose a \n",
      "username and password, and then enter your username and password each time \n",
      "you use the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a look at systems operating under these two approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) NASA Electronic Procurement Pilot (EPRO)--Digital Signature Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "The NASA Electronic Procurement Pilot, known as EPRO, relies on two \n",
      "digital software programs.  Vendors responding to solicitations build \n",
      "documents and bundle them together within one program.  They then\n",
      "sign cover sheets with a digital signature using another program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that it takes time to deploy these tools and explain how \n",
      "to use them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Officials are debating a possible move toward a more liberal electronic \n",
      "signature approach, one that has been coined \"Reverse EPS.\"  (EPS refers \n",
      "to Electronic Posting System, which is the backbone of the federal \n",
      "government's primary contracting opportunity site, FedBizOpps.gov.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Reverse EPS would help get around the deployment problem.  Offerors would \n",
      "log onto a secure NASA server then upload all files associated with the \n",
      "procurement action (such as proposal response or contract execution).  \n",
      "The signature event would be a combination of logging in and submitting \n",
      "the documents while logged in.  There'd be no extra software to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main concern with this approach is lack of authentication.  (Misused \n",
      "usernames/passwords; is the signatory the person he says he is? etc.)  \n",
      "Although such a system likely would be on solid legal footing (i.e., \n",
      "ESIGN), agency officials could, in the end, decide they're not \n",
      "comfortable with one that lacks PKI security.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2) eMaryland Marketplace--Electronic Signature Approach \n",
      "\n",
      "The state of Maryland launched eMaryland Marketplace on March 8, 2000, \n",
      "just before adopting the UETA.  Currently 1,800 vendors participate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Using eMaryland, vendors register and sign an authorization agreement.    \n",
      "Users \"sign\" documents by logging in and submitting them to the system.  \n",
      "There are no PKI software installation requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that eMaryland officials want to move virtually all state \n",
      "procurement activity through the system.  Plans for the near future \n",
      "include moving major construction projects (those over $100,000) online \n",
      "(including bonding management and submission of costing sheets).\n",
      "\n",
      "The state's adoption of the UETA, and its resulting reliance on electronic \n",
      "(as opposed to digital) signatures, makes rapid deployment possible.  \n",
      "\n",
      "THE BETTER APPROACH\n",
      "\n",
      "Between EPRO and eMaryland, which approach is better?  \n",
      "\n",
      "We come down on the side of eMaryland.  We believe that, in general, the \n",
      "lower costs and rapid deployment associated with electronic signatures \n",
      "outweigh the security benefits of digital signatures.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic signatures do not radically alter the legal landscape.  \n",
      "Signature requirements aren't exactly stringent under traditional \n",
      "contract law.  Over the years, courts have deemed a variety of methods \n",
      "valid in establishing signatures: names on telegrams, typed names, names \n",
      "on letterhead, and faxed signatures, for example.  Under the Uniform \n",
      "Commercial Code \"any symbol executed or adopted by a party with present \n",
      "intention to authenticate a writing\" is a valid signature.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Courts have always had to deal with such issues as forgery.  They can \n",
      "handle more modern authentication problems such as misused passwords.   \n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "We hope that this installment has helped you sort through some of the \n",
      "legal underpinnings of the e-procurement systems you've joined or will \n",
      "be joining soon.  (In Installment 32, we'll take a close look at some of \n",
      "the major systems.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that we wanted to let you know that you may be required to \n",
      "install, learn to use, and, in some cases, pay licensing fees for PKI \n",
      "software.  It appears that the trend is in the opposite direction, \n",
      "however, with the widespread adoption of the UETA at the state level, \n",
      "and the development of electronic signature-based systems such as \n",

      "** INSTALLMENT 1: INTRODUCTION TO THE GOVERNMENT IT MARKET **\n",
      "\n",
      "Governments at all levels are becoming citizen-centric in delivering \n",
      "services, e.g., developing Internet portals that provide single points \n",
      "of entry for citizens and businesses. Governments are recognizing the \n",
      "need for systems planning and integration, standard enterprise \n",
      "architectures, and XML technology to provide citizens with single points \n",
      "of access.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To accomplish these awesome tasks, most governments are initiating \n",
      "various forms of web-based e-government systems and are relying on the \n",
      "private sector to carry out the implementation.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Concurrently, the events of 9/11 have created a new focus on security \n",
      "and the use of information technology to defend against terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there’s good news for IT companies.  The opportunities are there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, the process is not as fraught with red tape as in days past.  \n",
      "Government procurement methods have been generally streamlined and \n",
      "simplified for two basic reasons: (1) commercial IT products and \n",
      "services are always cheaper and often better than those built to tight \n",
      "government-specifications; and (2) government officials want to buy \n",
      "more quickly, with less hassle and paperwork, in meeting agency goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "* ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT IT MARKET *\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re with a commercial IT company entering the government market \n",
      "for the first time, it can be a bit like visiting a foreign country.  \n",
      "The language is different (even though there’s less red tape).  There \n",
      "are no familiar faces.  And you may even find yourself bewildered and \n",
      "jet lagged.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The lead-time before your first sale is often long -- frequently over \n",
      "a year -- and the dollar investment is large.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You must have patience and perseverance in this market, especially if \n",
      "you sell complex IT products or services.  Why?  Here are just a few \n",
      "reasons: \n",
      "\n",
      "· Relationship-building is the key and that often takes time, \n",
      "particularly if you’re just starting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "· Related to that: IT projects that go awry can lead to agency shakeups.  \n",
      "When a state CIO, for example, contracts with an IT company that \n",
      "eventually screws up, he could find himself out of a job.  A lot is at \n",
      "stake, both politically and economically.  As a contractor, you’ve got \n",
      "to earn trust -- convince people you won’t screw up -- before things \n",
      "start to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Getting a GSA Schedule contract (almost a must for IT companies in \n",
      "the federal sector) can take six months or longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Large public procurements can take up to a year or more from inception \n",
      "to contract award.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can overcome these obstacles, reduce the long lead-time, and keep \n",
      "the dollar investment reasonably commensurate with the return.  In the \n",
      "end, success requires two things: a complete commitment on the part of \n",
      "management and an intense focus on the part of the business development/\n",
      "sales organization.   \n",
      "\n",
      "* SELLING TO GOVERNMENTS *\n",
      " \n",
      "Companies new to government sales think that once they land a GSA \n",
      "Multiple Award Schedule Contract, they’re set.  The orders will start \n",
      "rolling in. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s wrong of course, for most companies anyway.  (Almost no one \n",
      "sells something so unique, and in such high demand, that hard selling \n",
      "isn’t required.)  GSA Schedule or not, the government does not come to \n",
      "you.  You must be proactive, just like the commercial sector.\n",
      "\n",

In general, we have been getting more interaction with Accenture government teams. They are interested on our capabilities. In addition to Tim Shea (Accenture Government, USPS), we spoke to Accenture folks in Ottawa yesterday that had already played with Siebel Handheld and are interested in our differentiating capabiities. But they need to start \"kicking the tires\" now for prototypes to be used to influence government decision makers.\n",

      "NEW YORK -- JetBlue Airways, a low-fare airline, implemented a wireless curbside check-in system to shorten lines during busy travel periods. The mobile check-in solution, the first of its kind in the U.S. and codeveloped by Datavision-Prologix and Barcode Products, allows designated JetBlue staff to check in passengers, print boarding passes, and check luggage virtually anywhere inside or outside the terminal.  \"Waiting in line only adds to the stress of flying during peak travel weekends like Memorial Day,\" says Jeff Cohen of JetBlue. \"This unique system not only cuts frustration and saves time for our passengers, it helps us keep our operations running smoothly and on-time, by allowing us to get passengers, especially late ones, checked in and to the plane without delay.\"  Currently, the wireless check-in service is only available at JetBlue's base in Terminal 6 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, but the airline plans to roll it out to all its other city operations shortly.  The handheld system, which consists of a wireless local area Radio Frequency (RF) network, portable data terminals, and portable receipt/ticket printer, also allows JetBlue staff to access passenger and flight information via a wireless realtime connection to the HP Open Skies reservation system.

      "Upon its completion of the applicable Professional Services, AvocadoIT will advise Customer in writing (“Notice of Completion”) that the Application is performing substantially in conformity to the applicable DDS on the AvocadoIT Mobile Application Server, and inform Customer how it may access and test the Application remotely.   \n",
      "Customer will, within 5 business days of the date of the Notice of Completion, access the Application via Remote Access and test it to determine whether or not it functions in substantial conformity to the applicable DDS. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unless Customer provides AvocadoIT a reasonably detailed, written notice (pursuant to Section 11.1 of the MA) that describes any non-conformities from the applicable DDS that Customer finds after testing the Application pursuant to Section 5.2 so AvocadoIT can reproduce such non-conformities (the “Deficiency Notice”) within five days of the date of the Notice of Completion, “Acceptance” of the Application will be deemed to occur upon the fifth business day (the “Acceptance Date”) after the date of such Notice of Completion.\n",
      "In the event that Customer does provide AvocadoIT a Deficiency Notice as specified in Section 5.3, AvocadoIT will use commercially reasonable efforts and Customer will cooperate fully with its efforts, to revise the Application within 5 business days so that such Application performs in substantial conformity to the applicable DDS.  AvocadoIT will again provide a Notice of Completion pursuant to Section 5.1 and Customer will again test and approve or disapprove such revised Application pursuant to Section 5.2.\n",

      "\n",
      "\t7.1\tIf at any time, AvocadoIT’s performance of any scheduled Professional Services is delayed because of Customer’s failure to fulfill its obligations under this PSA, any SOW, Change Order or otherwise, or because Customer fails to provide any required deliverable in accordance with the mutually agreed upon timeline specified in any Agreement, ART, DDS or any other document (except if any such failure or delay is the result of an act or omission of AvocadoIT), then (i) AvocadoIT will maintain the availability of the required staffing for the Project unless and until Customer provides AvocadoIT written notice that AvocadoIT may reassign its employees, (ii) Customer will be billed monthly at the ‘Daily Staffing Rate’ specified in the applicable SOW or Change Order, and (iii) Customer will be invoiced such amount as a separate item outside of the payment schedule specified in the applicable SOW or Change Order.

      "What's in a name? Not much, at least according to water cooler conversations with vendors and users the past week. PwC Consulting's new name, Monday, elicited smirks, groans, horrible puns, and, most of all, questions. \"What day of the week do you hate most?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "You can see the appeal of good old \"Monday\" compared with the kooky e-consulting names of recent years. While many of us are not at our best on this particular day, when paying top-dollar for business and technology expertise, we'd prefer to pay it to people who are. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it's a pity that the consulting arms of the former Big Five have to spend millions developing and testing a brand, when what's important is future execution and delivery. Will the get-up-and-go, hardworking, overachieving moniker \"Monday\" successfully attach itself to PwC Consulting, which is all of those things? When you start hearing \"Monday and Motorola\" or \"Monday and Bristol-Myers Squibb\" (both PwC Consulting clients) mentioned in the same sentence, you'll know the transition has been successful. \n",
      "\n",
      "We look forward to hearing what Deloitte Consulting and KPMG Consulting come up with. Chances are, people will laugh at them too, but it doesn't matter. Starting fresh as a separate company accomplishes one very important thing: eliminating the conflict of interest inherent in advising and auditing the same clients. And once the new firm proves it will continue to meet its commitments, it doesn't matter how weird its name is. Accenture taught us that.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Novell is acquiring SilverStream software for $9 a share, or $212M total. Novell also gains approximately $100M from SilverStream's balance sheet, requiring a net cash outlay of $112M. David Litwack, the current CEO of SilverStream, plans to stay with the organization and run SilverStream as a business unit, reporting to Novell Vice Chairman Chris Stone. Novell emphasized the synergy between SilverStream and Novell's acquisition of Cambridge Technology Partners (CTP) just about a year ago, with management likening the new combo to an IBM. The combined employee count will number just more than 6,500, with SilverStream bringing 480 employees.  It does not anticipate a reduction in head count. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since the application server market is dominated by vendors such as IBM and BEA Systems, SilverStream was unlikely to be a leading J2EE-based application server vendor, so it has expanded its product line to other areas the past couple years, including portals, integration, and Web services development. Novell detailed a three-prong approach to supporting Web services, combining Novell's Cambridge Solutions organization for strategy and delivery; SilverStream for application development, portal and interaction servers, the application server, and integration; and Novell for supplying management pieces, including the network, identity management, directory services, and security. Novell expects to be able to increase revenue from SilverStream products as well as use the acquisition to spur new interest and confidence in its traditional product, Netware. \n",
      "\n",
      "The company is emphasizing its ability to support a heterogeneous environment, where customers can opt out of various options, selecting a J2EE application server from another vendor or a Novell channel partner for services rather than CTP. Novell gains some good talent and products from SilverStream and provides a reasonable story for a comeback. Now it needs to grow the value of SilverStream as a part of a much larger company; it's a problem Mr. Litwack faced before, when Sybase acquired PowerBuilder, with not so satisfactory results. Still, the advent of Web services is providing an opening for vendors to jockey for position all over again, and Novell is taking a significant step forward to let us know that it wants to be back in the game.\n",

      "Dear Peter,\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for not getting back to your earlier, but I was out of the office on\n",
      "a training for a week and then had to catch up with quite a few things.\n",
      "Anyway, please find my answers to your questions below:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Where would the presetation to the Novartis CRM consulting\n",
      "  board take place?\n",
      "\n",
      "   As it relates to the meeting, it turns out that we have to postpone the\n",
      "   whole meeting due to unavailabilities of people. However, besides\n",
      "   myself, there is another key CRM person who is the European CIO (Ed\n",
      "   Ball) and he will be here in Basel anyway beginning of March. I suggest\n",
      "   that we take that opportunity to get an introduction from your side.\n",
      "   Jenny will arrange for the details. This meeting will be in Basel.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How far along are you in your Siebel implementation?\n",
      "\n",
      "   We have gone through a global project last year to identify the CRM\n",
      "   strategy and framework for the top ten countries. Besides that, we have\n",
      "   been running CRM implementation projects in UK and Spain and have\n",
      "   started projects in France and Mexico. There are further projects in the\n",
      "   pipeline for US, Spain and Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How may potential mobile users of Siebel do you have\n",
      "  and where are they primarily located?\n",
      "\n",
      "   If you refer to handheld devices with \"mobile users of Siebel\", we will\n",
      "   be deploying Siebel on 432 HP Jornadas in Mexico. Besides that, we are\n",
      "   using handheld devices (also HP Jornadas) in Portugal for 174 sales\n",
      "   reps. For the project in the US, we will be running pilots on handhelds\n",
      "   to check feasibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Is there an active project at Novartis to explore\n",
      "  mobile access to Novartis' Siebel ePharma system?\n",
      "\n",
      "   As mentioned above, this will be done with the project in Mexico.\n",
      "   Although this is first project with handheld devices and Siebel's\n",
      "   ePharma system, we have already quite some experience with the technical\n",
      "   architecture as it is the same than what we have implemented in\n",
      "   Portugal.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Is any consulting firm involved with Novartis's Siebel\n",
      "  implemenation?\n",
      "\n",
      "   For the global project that we did last, we have been working with PWC.\n",
      "   As the CRM implementations are local projects, we also leave the\n",
      "   decision for selecting a partner for implementation up to the countries.\n",
      "   Hence, we are working with different partners in the countries.\n",
      "\n",

      "Matt and I attended the Gartner Group conference on Wireless Access and Mobile Business Solutions in Chicago earlier this week.  The conference was well attended with over 500 people representing approximately 200 companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were not a lot of vendors hosting booths, but those that did seemed to get good traffic.  Most notable was Cisco who distributed free wireless LAN cards for each attendee, and hosted a wireless LAN at the event.  Aether, distributed SHARP PDA’s on loan during the show to capture questions wirelessly off of their Web site.  These devices were returned at the end of the show.  Expensive, but high profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the highest level Gartner was encouraging businesses to find a way to get started, and confirmed that the wireless mobile computing revolution was coming.  Their earliest prediction for widespread deployment of ubiquitous wireless application capability was 2004-2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message at the show was conflicted for the pure wireless players, and not overly encouraging for those vendors in the next year.  Inversely, all the challenges identified in rolling out pure wireless applications are very supportive of our strategy to support mobile computing as an extension of current enterprise infrastructure.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This was most clearly articulated by Alan Jones, CIO of Citibank who told his internal IT group, and the event audience, that 95% of their current infrastructure was of no value in the deployment of pure wireless applications.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a massive obstacle in the current economy where capital expenditures and discretionary spending are being avoided and highly scrutinized.  Coupled with the lack of current availability of hi bandwidth carrier networks and a heavy device “mobility tax (add on's you need to be pure wireless), there are huge barriers to quick and widespread adoption of pure wireless applications for B to E.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have captured sound bytes from my notes that both summarize the key messages of the event, and in many cases promote directly the need for products in our category.   Please take the time to read through these and absorb them.  No matter what your role in our company, we need you connected to our mission, and your intellectual horsepower to help us take advantage of our opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these messages have been worked into the presentation we are using for our Spring Seminar Series, and were received warmly in Chicago this week at our opening event.\n",

We had a very good follow-up meeting with Navitaire at the Accenture Travel & Transportation Services meeting in Florida this week; you will be getting meeting notes shortly. We are developing Navitaire as a channel partner so that we can create one market offering for delivery to these start-up airline customers. The specific accounts we discussed as joint pursuits include Alaska, jetBlue, AirTran, and possibly some European regional players.\n",

      "Program and the Small Disadvantaged Business Certification (SDB) \n",
      "Program.\n",
      "\n",
      "* BACKGROUND: THE LAW *\n",
      "\n",
      "The Small Business Act of 1953 states that minority-owned businesses \n",
      "(and small businesses generally) should enjoy the \"maximum practical \n",
      "opportunity\" to participate in federal contacting.  The Small Business \n",
      "Act established the Small Business Administration (SBA) to assist such \n",
      "businesses and to insure they receive a \"fair proportion\" of federal \n",
      "contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the case of women-owned businesses (WOSBs), Congress has \n",
      "established a 5-percent government-wide goal for awards to small \n",
      "disadvantaged businesses (SDBs).\n",
      "\n",
      "* THE PROGRAMS *\n",
      "\n",
      "The SBA administers two business assistance programs for small \n",
      "disadvantaged businesses: the 8(a) Business Development Program and \n",
      "the Small Disadvantaged Business Certification (SDB) Program.  One big \n",
      "difference between the two: the 8(a) Program offers a broad scope of \n",
      "assistance to socially and economically disadvantaged firms, while SDB \n",
      "certification applies only to benefits in federal procurement.  8(a) \n",
      "firms automatically qualify for SDB certification. \n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind, as you read this article, that states have similar \n",
      "programs in place.  The requirements for participation are generally the \n",
      "same, as are the sales and marketing principles.  (An example of such \n",
      "a program is Vermont's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program,\n",
      "http://www.aot.state.vt.us/CivilRights/Dbe.htm.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some details on the two major federal programs:\n",
      "\n",
      "SECTION 8(A) PROGRAM\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act empowers the SBA to enter into \n",
      "contracts with other agencies to provide supplies, services and \n",
      "construction.  In contracting with another agency, the SBA \n",
      "subcontracts all of the performance requirements to a \"socially and \n",
      "economically disadvantaged small business concern.\"  Vendor \n",
      "participation is divided into two phases over nine years: a four-year \n",
      "developmental stage and a five-year transition stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eligibility \n",
      "\n",
      "To qualify for the program, a small business must be owned and \n",
      "controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual.  \n",
      "Presumed disadvantaged groups include African Americans, Hispanic \n",
      "Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Other individuals can be admitted to the program if they show through \n",
      "a \"preponderance of the evidence\" that they are disadvantaged because \n",
      "of race, ethnicity, gender, physical handicap, or residence in an \n",
      "environment isolated from the mainstream of American society. \n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals must have a net worth of less than $250,000, excluding the \n",
      "value of the business and personnel residence.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can apply to the 8(a) Program by contacting any SBA district office,\n",
      "http://www.sba.gov/regions/states.html.  For more information or \n",
      "questions, call the Division of Program Certification & Eligibility \n",
      "at (202) 205-6417. \n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits  \n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest and most powerful benefit of 8(a) participation: vendors \n",
      "can receive sole-source contracts up to a cap of $3 million for goods \n",
      "and services and $5 million for manufacturing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The SBA has signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with 25 federal \n",
      "agencies allowing them to contract directly with certified 8(a) firms \n",
      "(bypassing the SBA's traditional role as \"middleman\").  Recent changes \n",
      "permit 8(a) firms to form joint ventures and teams to bid on contracts.  \n",
      "These changes were intended to help overcome the effects of contract \n",
      "bundling, the combining of two or more contracts together into one \n",
      "large contract. \n",
      "\n",
      "SDB PROGRAM \n",
      "\n",
      "Eligibility \n",
      "\n",
      "A small business must be at least 51% owned and controlled by a \n",
      "socially and economically disadvantaged individual or individuals.  \n",
      "Presumed disadvantaged groups are the same as the 8(a) Program.  Other \n",
      "individuals can qualify if they show by a \"preponderance of the \n",
      "evidence\" that they are disadvantaged. \n",
      "\n",
      "All individuals must have a net worth of less than $750,000, excluding \n",
      "the equity of the business and primary residence.  Participants must \n",

      "disadvantaged businesses are eligible for price evaluation adjustments \n",
      "of up to 10 percent when bidding on federal contracts in certain \n",
      "industries.  The program also provides evaluation credits for prime \n",

      "Reskilling: Training the Talent to Shine. Keeping IT talent current is a major concern for IT organizations (ITOs). Highly competent people need time to refresh their skills, and training should not be ad hoc or left to employees' discretion. On average, each IT staff member currently receives 40 hours of training per calendar year. For world-class corporations, formal training averages 80 hours per year, plus 40 hours of mentoring and individual coaching to refine current skills. Leading firms find that applying more resources, including training, to their best performers results in increased productivity and institutional value. By 2005, more than 75% of Global 2000 firms will increase formal training of their best performers to 80 hours per year. However, companies will restrict additional training for mediocre and poorly performing employees and provide periodic performance reviews.\n",

      "Thin-Client Computing Types and Value Propositions. Moving to thin clients has been the topic of much hype and debate. The key is understanding the three major thin-client models and their value propositions. Thin-client technologies are important tools for IT to control costs in the end-user environment. Successful enterprises will realize that reducing end-user costs is not about one perfect solution, but about combining multiple techniques to improve operations. To learn more about thin clients, listen to this audio briefing presented by META Group analysts Steve Kleynhans and Val Sribar and view the accompanying slides.\n",

      "From Net Market (Back) to Extranet. Many organizations are attempting to exorcise the \"e-business demons\" they created during the past two to three years; most Global 2000 enterprises are now racing away from constructs like Net markets. Organizations are now refocusing on extranets (and B2B portals with them) to enable process- and data-level integration and collaboration among enterprises. By 2005, B2B portals (delivered via extranet) will have superseded all notions of private Net markets, enabling the delivery of applications and information while hosting transactional capabilities, in some cases for the entire set of constituents (e.g., suppliers, customers, partners). Consortium Net markets will continue to prove themselves through 2004, with successful entities providing outsourced extranet/portal (i.e., private) services (in addition to centralized industry/market services) to organizations that do not wish to shoulder that burden. www.metagroup.com/featurelink/netmarkettoextranet\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SAP made some long-anticipated management and organizational changes to help bolster some of its sagging regional prospects as it prepares for its Americas SAPPHIRE user conference in early June. Wolfgang Kemna, president of SAP America, has been reassigned to head a global initiatives function in Germany. Leo Apotheker, president of SAP's European, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) region, is taking on worldwide field operations, specifically acting as head of the North American region with Kemna's departure. Apotheker, a long-term SAP veteran, started SAP's French operation in the late 1980s and has taken on increasing responsibilities in the firm's European operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kemna's two-year tenure as SAP America president was marked by declining license revenue and layoffs, as the U.S. economy slipped deeper into recession. As the division's performance in North America did not match SAP's results in Europe and Asia/Pacific, it became increasingly apparent that management changes were needed to help SAP crack untapped business segments, including the mid-market and service-based firms. North American customers will get to meet the hard-charging Apotheker as he hosts this year's conference in Orlando, where he is to set the tone for the North American organization for the remainder of 2002. Look for SAP to hire for this position outside of its own ranks as it searches for a long-term solution to its rotating SAP America president role.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Three years ago, Application Service Providers (ASPs) hit the IT scene with new vendors, partnerships, and big promises and were hailed as the way enterprises would buy software in the future.  The \"ASP\" term has been used to describe outsourcers, enterprise application management/hosting, network service providers, Internet service providers, business process outsourcers, co-location firms, and managed services providers, to name just a few.  Then the dot-com scene busted and most of the early high-flying ASPs went into a tailspin from the loss of customers and the inability to regain losses from a failed business model. \n",
      "\n",
      "USinternetworking (USi), one of the most well known, fell with the rest, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2002.  However, with the backing of Bain Capital, USi is now reemerging with restructuring complete, a new business model, and $81M in fresh funding.  The question is whether that will be enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "To help bolster its chances, USi is also merging with Interpath, another ASP/infrastructure service provider. Combined, the new company will have revenues of nearly $150M.  Coming out of bankruptcy, USi is trying to improve the operational side of the business, which is where most ASPs have struggled.  The second generation of service providers to hit the market learned from the mistakes of others and is concentrating on the service aspect of the business, developing strategic partnerships, and building a more sound business model, based on a combination of product and service. \n",
      "\n",
      "Opportunities do exist in application management and hosting services as more companies pare down IT resources to their core competencies while looking for strategic partners to help manage their operations.  Building a business model that is sustainable and can offer multiple services, in a more cost-effective manner, is the successful route.  Outsourcing is a very sound option for many companies; however, they will be looking to partner with financially stable, long-term business service providers.  If the combined USi and Interpath organization can build a viable business model, it will be worthwhile for companies to look at them as an alternative in the crowded service provider market. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FileNET has made a move to expand its content management footprint, acquiring Web Content Management (WCM) vendor eGrail. The $10M, all-cash transaction allows FileNET to add Web content workflow, templating, and aggregation to its portfolio. The acquisition also adds over 40 employees to the firm. In the past, FileNET had relied primarily on a partnership with Vignette to offer customers WCM capability. \n",
      "\n",
      "By acquiring eGrail, FileNET expands its application set to include Website management and HTML creation. The company plans to integrate its flagship document management product, Panagon, and Brightspire, its Business Process Management (BPM) product, with eGrail. In addition, eGrail will continue to be sold as a stand-alone product (but not by the eGrail name) near its typical range of $100K to $125K. At the end of 2002, FileNET plans to release a pure J2EE version of WCM functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great move at an opportune time. The idea of selling WCM stand alone is smart, especially at such a low price point, and prospects should be convinced that FileNET is a decent viability bet compared to a stand-alone eGrail--or compared to dozens of other small content management vendors. Better yet, FileNET can sell into a substantial installed base at a time when users are wary of dealing with new vendors. In the short term, the products can be bolted together quite easily, giving FileNET customers an easier and cheaper means of publishing their document content on the Web. In the longer term, FileNET will be a much more imposing as a content management competitor when the products share the same workflow engine in the capable Brightspire product.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kronos is using a new agreement with Best Software to springboard into the Human Resource Management System (HRMS) market, with an offering aimed at companies with 500 to 1,500 employees.  Kronos already has a strong presence in the mid-market with its existing labor management products, including time, attendance, and scheduling software. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, Best will provide Kronos with the source code to Abra Enterprise.  Kronos will rebrand it as Workforce HR and Workforce Payroll; both will be integrated into Kronos' existing Workforce Central suite.  To make the product more competitive, Kronos will add functionality, particularly in compensation and recruiting, to the existing HR, payroll and employee self-service functionality.  Mid-market users often find that their workforce management requirements are as complex as those of large enterprises, so it makes sense to enhance this functionality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kronos isn't the only vendor to recognize the opportunity in the mid-market.  It will face increasing competition from existing mid-market vendors with HRMS products, like Microsoft Great Plains Business Solutions and interBiz (now owned by SSA Global Technologies), as well as from PeopleSoft, which is succeeding in the mid-market with competitively priced, fixed scope implementations.  The buyers in this market tend to want to get all of their enterprise software from the same vendor, possibly giving vendors like PeopleSoft and Great Plains an edge, with their more complete product sets.  But other mid-market have either basic HR functionality or none at all--leaving an opening for Kronos to come in with a strong HR and labor management suite.    \n",

      "Subject: New! requirements from today's discussions with Biogen\n",
      "Date: 24 Jan 2002 06:17:29 UTC\n",
      "Message-ID: <FC38A9406AA4D411AB62009027DE9DA5018F5C30@ntmachs10-7-2-11.avocadoit.com>\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a very productive if not surprising session with Biogen today. They continue to vacillate or we are finally understanding and documenting their REAL requirements. Here are some of the key issues along with our proposed responses. Nothing has been promised to Biogen at this point. We welcome all comments or alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prakash, please review. We include you in on a conference call tomorrow, early-mid afternoon EST. I have to confirm exact time with Mark M.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PIM sync - Mark wants to have server sync to accommodate PC users (not laptop users) who are not replicated. In other words, because the PC users data is on the Notes server, we cannot sync locally. We believe this is a political requirement because a few executives (e.g. Leslie), not field workers, are in the office and might want to sync the PIM. Here are a few options:\n",
      "a. Deliver as a phase I requirement (NO)\n",
      "b. Deliver in some later phase and as a change order.\n",
      "c. Say no and have the PC users replicate\n",
      "We think the best approach is (c) and consider (b) for the future, not in the current discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Single sync - Their idea of single sync is to sync everything. This requirement has now become, using the laptop to initiate: sync PIM local & Siebel server (which is what we view as single sync) , sync Notes client to server, sync Siebel client to server, all in one simple \"one button\" process. We don't believe this is technically feasible but Meghan (Accenture) had worked on a similar project and is investigating the Siebel/Notes client to server sync. Again we have a few alternatives:\n",
      "a. Deliver this new unified sync at a later phase assuming it can be done\n",
      "b. Say no and deliver single sync as we view it, i.e. cradle insert initiated sync for PIM/Siebel. Other sync would have to occur manually or be implemented by Accenture.\n",
      "c. Say no but make our sync available on the laptop (with an option of program-driven initiation) and again have Accenture implement a solution.\n",
      "We think (b) is our preference. If (c) is simple enough it might make it easier for Accenture and the end user but we would probably have to defer it to the phase 2 timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Client application security - They want to have authentication on the device to control access to the Siebel app. along with idle timeouts. The user would have to authenticate before using the app. If left idle, the user would have to reauthenticate. This would be local authentication independent of other security mechanisms. As with the current implementation, the \"real\" Siebel user/password is still saved locally. No PIM authentication needed.\n",
      "a. no.\n",
      "b. yes.\n",
      "Appears to be a relatively straightforward and reasonable request. o.k. in this phase (b) especially because Siebel is phase 2. Prakash has indicated initial agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Management of PIM data - The ability to control the amount of data stored on the pocketPC. Not just controlling the data to be sync'd, but also managing the purging of old data. For example, all appointments prior to today would be deleted from the PIM sync'd data. We would have to parameterize and handle purge/maintenance.\n",
      "a. Deliver this for phase 1.\n",
      "b. Deliver this as an enhancement but not in phase 1.\n",
      "c. Say no.\n",
      "We have not really discussed this at length (if we did I forget the outcome, sorry...). So my personal view is (c) with a possible consideration of (b).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Security of Siebel data - They have asked for encryption of XML data on the device. Prakash says this is already true. In the current version(s) or in the upcoming 4.0 release? In any case, seems reasonable and it's going to be in the product. No problem agreeing to this as a requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've read this entire email, then we (Diana, Richard F., and I) would sincerely appreciate your input. Please send your comments via email to \"biogenproject\". Prakash, please review any comments and be available for a meeting sometime between 9-11am your time.\n",

      "4.       Labor started at 4:30 AM on Thurs April 4 and he was born next AM at 5:09 at Columbia Presbyterian…most people want to know how we got to the hospital in Manhattan from Brooklyn – really good friends drove us (thank you Claudia and Russ)!  Yes, I wrote all my contractions down, with timings, duration, intensity and interval length – what else would I do for 24 hours\n",
      "5.       My sister Susan, a real trouper and Jose were with me through the whole thing – it was really fascinating, especially since the last 2 hours was pain free with an Epidural (whoopee!!)\n",
      "6.       He’s cute!  I’ll send pics – he looks like Jose….\n",

      "1)       100% effaced, better than 1 centimeter dilated, but less than 2, so I’m not moving so fast that I should be sitting at the hospital!\n",
      "2)       And, technically, I’m ready to go anytime\n",
      "3)       I’m due April 4, and if he is not here by April 9, then doc says no reason to go later (he looks to be ab 7- 7.5 lbs), so by next Tuesday’s check-up if I haven’t delivered, we schedule an inducement\n",
      "4)       Zoe had a real rough time with the spaying last Wed, slowly stopped eating and drinking and she’s only 4.5 lbs and she dropped .5 pounds by Saturday, so I was really getting freaked… we brought her to an emergency hospital on Easter at 8 AM - I was a wreck....thinking about me being at the hospital and the poor kitten dying just because we were having her spayed and she had a bad reaction....of course, I wasn't being very rational at the time…at the hospital they injected her with fluids under her skin…turns out cats are like camels and if they’re not behaving well food/drink-wise, they can make them feel better and kick-start their system by this fluid work…when she came home late Sunday night, she was squishy for two days!   Zoe had a good check-up last night and is starting to eat and drink on her own….I said I couldn’t go into labor until she was better because who would take care of her, so my sister Susan is now here to help out (actually, she was going to come anyway, but this makes me feel better about the poor little kitty)!\n",
      "5)       Heart burn is a little less, so maybe he dropped!\n",
      "6)       Work, I’m more dis-engaged from….less work than last week too. \n",
      "7)       Missed having birth by the Met’s home opener, but we won so that was good\n",
      "8)       Sill 22 boxes of crap in the second bedroom….\n",
      "9)       Had a nice Easter in spite of the cat, my Mom who’s had a little of a rough time lately (and lives in Philly), came with my sister Kate and her two daughters, so a good time was hap by all….and I really wanted to see my Mom before the baby came, so I was really happy that my sister made that happen.\n",

      "Opening the Doors to Open Source. Open source software continues to expand, finding its way into corporate developer use and becoming the underlying foundation of commercial software. The use of open source software will become a standard part of all organizations utilizing Java by 2003, with a high number already using the Apache Web server (60% of active sites) and a significant group using open source Java servers (14%). The majority of organizations will initially make transparent use of software derived from open source foundations in binary form. However, as the number of standard technologies in Java continues to grow, a greater number will become part of the source code base of an organization. Organizations must establish specific policies to control how open source is utilized.\n",

      "Pervasive Technology Deployment: 10 Crucial Issues. Enterprises will deploy significantly more applications to pervasive devices during the next three to four years. By 2004/05, we expect Pocket PC (Windows CE-based) to have 50% share of the enterprise personal digital assistant (PDA) market, with Palm at 35%-40% and Linux-based devices at 10%-15% (primarily specialized devices for Java applications, single-purpose applications, etc.). Within four to five years, we expect improved smart phones (e.g., MSFT Stinger) and improved network rollouts (e.g., 2.5G/3G) to drive enterprise deployment of mission-critical applications to wireless devices (both smart phone-based and wireless modems attached to PDAs), with 15%-20% of enterprise mobile workers using these devices. Companies should address at least 10 crucial issues to improve the probability of success in deploying wireless/pervasive solutions.\n",

As more organizations adopt portfolio approaches to manage IT assets, measuring and communicating IT portfolio performance are rapidly becoming business mandates. To effectively manage IT as an investment portfolio, organizations must establish the appropriate measurement systems to optimize return on these investments. This entails designing and implementing scorecards that are focused on business value and enable continuing performance assessment. From executive communication to asset management, performance management, and priority setting, scorecards are an essential component of effective portfolio management.

Our research indicates high-end server purchases are starting to slowly increase after the marked slowdown (30%+) of the past 6-9 months. To drive server vendor discounting, many organizations still overemphasize volume purchasing.

Key applications will be 1)Information Delivery, 2)Educational Contents, 3)Comparison of Financial Products and 4)Transaction of Financial Products.

As an access method, mobile device is priority of the project.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ariba posted quarterly revenues just above guidance at $57.2M, hit a pro forma breakeven, and showed slight top-line and license revenue growth.  With a solid cash position and reduced burn rate from Q4, Ariba has stabilized financially.  The company is, however, relying heavily on its installed base to carry it through the troubled economy, with 50% of business this quarter from new customers and a third of revenue from new products.  Continued positive turnaround for the procurement vendor will therefore depend on market reception of its new spend management products: Ariba Invoice, Ariba Contracts, and Ariba Analysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although spend management does not address cross-enterprise demand, supply, or inventory management issues, it is a clear and intuitive message that resonates with procurement professionals and gives Ariba competitive distinction in the spend-management-deficient e-sourcing market.  Ariba should continue its up-sell path of providing value-added services and benchmarking to the company's installed base and not count the ASP eggs before they hatch.  It should be noted also that Ariba's newfound stability is in stark contrast to its nemesis Commerce One, which showed it is not surviving well without SAP in its Q1 earnings call last week.\n",

      "PeopleSoft Blames Q1 Shortfall on Drop in New Customer License Revenue \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PeopleSoft confirmed its Q1 earnings pre-announcement, reporting revenue of $32M less than previous guidance.  There were some positives, including earnings per share of 14 cents, up from 11 cents in 1Q01, and a record low Day Sales Outstanding (DSO) of 58 days, down from 63 days.  But other important indicators were down, including Average Sales Price (ASP), net new customers, and number of deals greater than $1M. \n",
      "\n",
      "The company had a larger-than-normal pipeline to begin Q1, so the steep drop in the conversion rate came as a surprise.  License revenue from existing customers was flat, but the biggest effect was that new customers represented only 25% of revenue, down from an average of 39%.  A bright spot was the education and government market, which continued to show some strength throughout the quarter. \n",
      "\n",
      "On a positive note, CEO Craig Conway noted that only a third of PeopleSoft customers have licensed PeopleSoft 8 so far, leaving a large group of customers that will probably license version 8 before support for version 7.5 ends early next year.  According to an AMR Research study, of those companies that upgraded to PeopleSoft 8, 62% added three modules (on average) when they upgraded.  Many customers used the upgrade as an opportunity to add core Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) modules and new application areas, such as portals, Internet procurement, and employee self-service. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conway says that corporate Information Technology (IT) departments have a budget but that they are unwilling to spend it until their own businesses start to see a solid recovery from the recession.  Conway expects to see relatively flat results for the second quarter, but he strongly believes that revenue will pick up in the second half of the year.  And the large group of customers still to upgrade, given the trend of purchasing additional modules, bodes well for the second half of the year.  Given PeopleSoft's cash position and strong management, it should easily be able to weather another quarter of flat earnings.\n",

No Siebel is on the desktop.  So even if its a laptop in a disconnected mode, they could not pull up Siebel information.  The PPC solution could fill in that gap.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Small Business Administration's HUBZone program provides contract \n",
      "preferences to qualified small firms located in over 8,000 designated \n",
      "HUBZone areas.  The purpose of the program is to increase employment, \n",
      "capital investment, and economic development to these relatively \n",
      "underdeveloped areas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "HUBZones can be as small as a city block or as large as an entire \n",
      "county.  They also include lands on Native American reservations.\n",
      "\n",
      "* PROGRAM BENEFITS * \n",
      "\n",
      "As of October 1, 2000, all federal buying agencies must follow HUBZone \n",
      "program requirements.  The annual contracting goals for the program \n",
      "were one percent of the total value of all federal prime contracts in \n",
      "FY 1999.  There are and will be annual increases of .5 percent until \n",
      "the program reaches its maximum goal of 3 percent in FY 2003. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are four types of HUBZone tools to help federal buyers their \n",
      "mandated goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  A HUBZone set-aside contract can be awarded if the contracting \n",
      "officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more HUBZone firms \n",
      "will submit offers and that the contract can be awarded at a fair \n",
      "market price. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  A sole source HUBZone contract can be awarded if the contracting \n",
      "officer doesn't have a reasonable expectation that two or more qualified \n",
      "HUBZone small businesses will submit offers, determines that the HUBZone \n",
      "firm is responsible and that the contract can be awarded at a fair price.  \n",
      "The government's estimate for a HUBZone sole source contract cannot \n",
      "exceed $5 million for manufacturing requirements or $3 million for other \n",
      "requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.  A full and open competition contract can be awarded with a \n",
      "10-percent price evaluation preference.  This preference is applied only \n",
      "if the low offeror is a large business. \n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Subcontracting plans for large business federal contractors must \n",
      "include a negotiated HUBZone subcontracting goal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "*  ELIGIBILITY * \n",
      "\n",
      "To participate in the HUBZone program, a firm must-- \n",
      "\n",
      "· Be small, \n",
      "· Be located in an \"historically underutilized business zone\" (HUBZone) \n",
      "· Be owned and controlled by one or more U.S. Citizens, and \n",
      "· Have at least 35% of its employees residing in a HUBZone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"HUBZone\" is an area that is located in one or more of the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "· A qualified census tract (as defined in section 42(d)(5)(C)(i)(1) of \n",
      "the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); \n",
      "\n",
      "· A qualified \"non-metropolitan county\" that is not located in a \n",
      "metropolitan statistical area (as defined in section 143(k)(2)(B) of the \n",
      "Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and in which the median household income \n",
      "is less than 80 percent of the non-metropolitan state median household \n",
      "income, or that based on the most recent data available from the \n",

      "\n",
      "Unless your principal place of business is in a HUBZone or unless you're \n",
      "willing to move to one, this topic isn't relevant to you.  Keep in mind, \n",
      "though, that HUBZones cover rather large areas throughout the country.  \n",
      "The SBA has developed special mapping software to help determine if a \n",
      "particular physical address is within a HUBZone.  To find out whether \n",
      "your company is within one, go to the following URL:  \n",
      "https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/general/findout.cfm.\n",
      "\n",
      "To see what types of contracts have been awarded to HUBZone companies, \n",
      "go to FedBizOpps.gov or use our own FedBiz Now, \n",
      "http://www.fedmarket.com/bidProducts/fbn/.  When you search, select \n",
      "\"Total HUB-Zone\" in the Set-Aside Code option.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your firm is HUBZone certified, the advice is much the same as it \n",
      "is for women- and minority-owned businesses: work your sales leads and \n",
      "make sure they're aware of your firm's HUBZone status.  Help the agency \n",
      "reach its HUBZone contracting goals, because these goals are important \n",
      "to agencies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "How important?  Here's one example: The \"Selling to the Air Force\" \n",
      "website tells the story of procurement officials at Robins Air Force \n",
      "Base in Georgia requesting bids from two HUBZone firms.  Initially both \n",
      "declined, saying the items were too difficult to manufacture.  The \n",

      "The competitive nature of the airline industry dictated that Alaska Airlines rapidly develop and\n",
      "deploy its mobile customer service solution.  It had to provide comprehensive functionality and\n",
      "be cost effective to implement and maintain.  Most mobile solutions, however, begin by building\n",
      "a redundant infrastructure just for the wireless environment instead of leveraging the existing\n",
      "applications and business logic already developed for wired applications.  This, of course, is in\n",
      "direct conflict with a rapid time-to-market goal.  In addition, wireless interaction had to be real-\n",
      "time, reliable, scalable and secure.  Wireless support needed to be incorporated into the\n",
      "advanced technology infrastructure, as well as delivering and managing data and content to a\n",
      "multitude of wireless devices.  These difficult challenges had to be accomplished in a timely,\n",

      "and achieve its goals. The delivery and management of data and content to mobile devices is\n",
      "a complex and specialized technological arena.  The mobile solution had to leverage the exist-\n",
      "ing infrastructure while capitalizing on readily available data and content contained in existing\n",
      "applications.  Many products available provided only limited device type support. However, this\n",
      "was not acceptable as Alaska Airlines wanted a device-independent solution to service as\n",
      "many customers as possible.  Other products, with a broader spectrum of device support,\n",
      "would not make efficient use of Alaska Airlines' infrastructure and applications.  This would\n",

Stuart has been helping us behind the scenes with some of the contract administration.  \n",

Of course, I can be available if there are any urgent questions.\n",

      "*\tThe  anniversary date for the  product discount schedule will be extended by 5 months to June of 2003 to better map back to the actual acceptance dates of the Biogen Mobile PIM application for Notes. (This should bridge any gap between the date the license is executed, and acceptance of the Biogen Mobile PIM code).\n",
      " \n",
      "*\tWe think we have a clear explanation of our Support Services, pricing, increase policies, etc. in the agreement at this point.  If we have anything missing that you feel is important, we can draft a letter confirming specifics of how we plan to deliver support to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\tWe have expanded the payment terms language on the custom development to include acceptance language.  The agreement calls for us to deliver on time, with the full functionality described, and for Biogen to test and notify us of any defect within 10 business days. \n",
      "\n",
      "*\tWe corrected the misstatement in the penalty language to provide a credit against Support Services Fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "*\tWe also agreed that while the synchronization to both a Note Server and Desktop would be required for a commercially available Note Connector product, the current statement of work is only focused on the synchronization to the desktop.  I will follow up with our team to better understand what is involved to add server synchronization in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will be checking email through the day on my Blackberry, and available via cell phone at 412-215-5282.  In the meantime, Peter and Stuart will be up early tomorrow, and try to call you at 8:30AM EDT tomorrow, to ensure you received the document, and quickly review the changes.

      "* FEDERAL PROGRAMS *\n",
      "\n",
      "The Law \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's begin with an overview of federal law:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Small Business Act of 1953 states that small businesses should \n",
      "receive a \"fair proportion\" of federal contracts and that small \n",
      "businesses should enjoy the \"maximum practical opportunity\" to \n",
      "participate in federal contacting.  The Small Business Act \n",
      "established the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help small \n",
      "businesses receive their \"fair proportion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 amended the \n",
      "Small Business Act to require the President to establish an annual \n",
      "government-wide goal of awarding not less than 20 percent of prime \n",
      "contract dollars to small businesses.  The Small Business \n",
      "Reauthorization Act of 1997 amended the Small Business Act still \n",
      "further to increase this goal to not less than 23 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the small business set-aside program, federal agencies \"set \n",
      "aside\" contracts exclusively for small business participation.  Federal \n",
      "Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(a) states that a purchase with \n",
      "\"an anticipated dollar value exceeding $2,500, but not over $100,000, \n",
      "is automatically reserved exclusively for small business concerns and \n",
      "shall be set aside for small business unless the contracting officer \n",
      "determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers \n",
      "from two or more responsible small business concerns that are \n",
      "competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.\"  This \n",
      "requirement often is referred to as the \"rule of two.\"\n",

      "An important first question to ask, then, is whether yours is in fact \n",
      "a small business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magic number is often 500 employees (i.e., if your company has 500 \n",
      "or less, it's a small business), yet the numbers vary widely from \n",
      "industry to industry.  The SBA often uses annual sales as the \n",
      "determining factor.  Those numbers also vary widely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the general size standards:\n",
      "\n",
      "· 500 employees for most manufacturing and mining industries \n",
      "· 100 employees for all wholesale trade industries \n",
      "· $6 million for most retail and service industries \n",
      "· $28.5 million for most general & heavy construction industries \n",
      "· $12 million for all special trade contractors \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of engineer-to-order projects underway at manufacturing companies is a wake-up call to many vendors that complex configuration continues to be in demand. In response, IBM continues to expand the reach of its sell-side applications strategy through acquisition and internal product development. Complex configuration--be it product-related or service-oriented--is one area that IBM needs to pay particular attention to as the WebSphere suite expands throughout the firm's broad customer base. Factors that led IBM to solidify its partnership with Selectica include the configuration vendor's development expertise with WebSphere and DB2, experience in engineer-to-order and services configuration, and growing expertise in guided selling and dynamic pricing. For Selectica, IBM's endorsement is just another indication that it is one of the strongest suppliers of complex configuration. \n",
      "\n",
      "IBM and Selectica's industry partnership brings increased configuration, guided selling, and lifecycle management functionality into the WebSphere product family. The bottom line: this partnership should deliver measurable results quickly, tackling the toughest of product configuration issues. Competitively, Firepond's Lead-to-Order initiative also captures the growing demand for complex configuration in manufacturing companies. Complex configuration and engineer-to-order is attracting competitors from the multi-channel order management arena, including Yantra, Model N, and Asera. We expect to see activity continue.\n",

      "Can Verticalnet Be the Atlas of Retail Commerce? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verticalnet's acquisition of Atlas Commerce late last year is starting to pay off.  The board of a Global 1000 retailer has approved a multimillion-dollar project to implement nearly all of the Collaborative Supply Chain--Strategic Sourcing, Collaborative Planning, and Order Management.  The $10B retailer expects to streamline purchasing and reduce costs.  The projected benefit--a 20% reduction in direct material costs in five years--will come from linking fragmented supplier networks (more than 200 suppliers), consolidating component and raw material purchasing, tracking raw material usage, and managing orders and contracts. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a much broader deployment of Verticalnet than Atlas Commerce implemented, but can't talk about, at the world's largest retailer.  But it looks like similar factors led to both decisions: aggregation and rationalization of global buying and sourcing, data confidentiality, community-level data and process models, common scalable architecture, and time to benefit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A condition in Atlas Commerce's contract with Wal-Mart not to sell applications to eight named retailers expires on October 31.  Can you imagine the conversation when Verticalnet account execs start calling on these accounts on November 1?  It might include a line like this: \"Hi, are you interested in the applications that have been so valuable to Wal-Mart that we've been prohibited from showing you for more than a year?\"  These retailers would be wise to at least take the call.\n",

      "We will configure an EMAS to connect to the Federal Express Sales server similar to the current setup used by remote Sales employees.  First, a mobile user on the EMAS will authenticate to the firewall using the SecurID token.  Once authenticated, that user session will only be allowed access to the Sales server.  The user will then have a separate authentication sequence for the Sales application. \n",

      "Alert! Oracle Multiplexing Causing User Apoplexy. META Group clients have recently reported aggressive attempts by Oracle to reinterpret its licenses to encompass batch processes as a form of multiplexing, claiming that users have \"misinterpreted\" their contracts. Based on our research, we believe it is Oracle that is misinterpreting its own contracts. Users should defy Oracle's indefensible attempts to raise prices on existing licenses.\n",

      "Storage Market Consolidation. Strategic relationships (application programming interface exchanges and reselling) were plentiful in the storage market during 2001. While storage vendor relationships can be beneficial, IT organizations must evaluate them based on commitments and vendor core competencies. We caution against relationships that are tactical or public-relations-based. Through 2003/04, we believe established storage vendors will continue developing key relationships (either development or distribution), striving to deliver storage software functionality that attempts to solve business and application issues. Of the recently established relationships, we believe Sun/Hitachi and EMC/Dell will be the most fruitful for end-user organizations.\n",

To ensure security program success, IT shops must establish an effective risk assessment process to balance security risks and costs associated with each new initiative. On Tuesday, March 26, META Group analysts will present a FREE Information Security How-To Teleconference focusing on the basic tenets of risk assessment. Attendees will learn best practices for assessing the risk of business initiatives, balancing security costs, and communicating the pros and cons of security measures to business executives.

      "Enterprise PDA Policy: Part 1. Many enterprises are already experiencing personal digital assistant (PDA) penetration rates of 10%-15% of knowledge workers, with most end users purchasing their own devices and bringing them into the company. By 2006, we expect the penetration rate to exceed 50%, as companion computing devices become less expensive ($200-$300 for high-end PDA versus the current $500-$600), become easier to connect (both wired and wireless, including smart phone devices), and offer more enterprise application connectivity (e.g., ERP, CRM, sales force automation, e-mail, expense reporting, order placement). Enterprises must establish clear policies addressing annualized full life-cycle cost, type of connectivity that will be available, levels of support, and criteria for receiving a company-furnished PDA. Failure to establish a PDA policy will result in anarchy, increasing cost to the organization and potentially putting corporate data at risk.\n",

Canada really would like to do this. I did not tell him about Peter's contact with the CIO.  The 50 seat pilot has 10 sales guys and 40 call center workers. He said if we throw in a free 10 seat pilot they might just go for it. He will send me the contact.\n",

      "\n",
      "The reason to go for Notes in Phase I is a CYA for many of the Biogen and Accenture guus acording to him. Because phase I date for handheld was committed and now that they cannot roll out Siebel by that time they want to simply change what goes in phase I and give out the devicesm Besides, when they took tha plan to sales guys they said if you want us to use it give the device earlier with calendar and contacts from Lotus.\n",

      "Siebel secures and  manages every account by a three man team. Sales exec and  a Pre-sales Siebel consultant does most of the work till contract is signed. A technical account manager come in after the deal is signed. In Biogen's case he was pulled in because Siebel was in danger of losing the account. Sebel has a red alert process. When an account becomes critical or a customer becomes unhappy based on the situation the sales exec( prospects) or TAM( signed deals)rates it as Red alert and it goes all the way up the chain to Tom Siebel. He was pulled  in as the expert on Pharma.\n",

Total biometric sales will exceed US$1 billion in 2004, with most deployments at airports, financial institutions, and healthcare facilities.\n",

      "Celent Communications examines how the continued impact of September 11 on the financial services industry has resulted in an increased focus on preventing fraud with better security methods, particularly biometrics. \"At a time when security fears have reached new heights, it has become increasingly obvious that current security methods, especially passwords, are not sufficient and are costly to maintain,\" says Christine Barry, Celent analyst and author of the report. \n",

      "Whatever happened to the dream of moving equipment financing into cyberspace and its dream weavers? Most loan and lease exchanges had a nightmare. Web-based technology, however, continues to house great potential for improving equipment financing performance according to Celent Communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a new report, entitled Equipment Financing in North America: Leveraging the Web, Alenka Grealish, wholesale banking analyst at Celent, examines the potential of Web-based solutions for equipment financing and trade credit. \"Given its Byzantine structure, equipment financing is ripe for efficiency gains and revenue enhancement through Web-based automation. Potential cost savings for the industry overall ranges from US$700 million to US$1,000 million and for manufacturers, trade credit automation could yield up to US$1,500 million in savings,\" concludes Grealish. \n",

      "Location: Conference Room - Santa Clara\n",
      "Start: 05 Jun 2001 18:00:00 UTC\n",

      "\n",
      "Fidelity Canada Account Team,\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to leaving AvocadoIT, Jeff Newman said that he would work with the AvocadoIT execs to determine if we should re-do the Fidelity Canada application in the EMDS tool in order for Fidelity to be able to make modifications to the application if they license our product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally this application had the most difficult Javascript over Frames we had ever been exposed to when it was first developed in the summer of '00.  EMDS wasn't as mature as it is now & couldn't handle this or the French characters required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the Fidelity Canada application has replaced much of the Javascript over Frames functionality with data from an XML feed, we have the opportunity of re-doing the application in the EMDS tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application is large & we've estimated that the Eng/French smartphone applications would take approx. 60 person days to re-do in EMDS.  Their recently added Eng/French RIM application (which we were paid only a minor amount of money to re-position from the smartphone application) would take approx. 40 person days to do in EMDS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dilemma lies in that Fidelity Canada will most likely not want to pay for any of this work since they probably believe that their application was originally developed in EMDS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Fidelity Canada is apparently very interested in purchasing our Licensed product in the end of June timeframe in order to maintain and enhance their application, we need to decide what we're going to do regarding this issue ASAP since even with multiple developers it will be a challenge to meet this timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also the issue regarding support of the application after Fidelity Canada has tweaked it that we need to come up with a clear position on.\n",
      "\n",

      "Firepond Weathers Firestorm Over Falsified Contracts \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to close software deals in a tough market, the former vice president of sales at Firepond falsified three contracts worth $5M in 2002. The falsified contracts were with Bombardier and a mining equipment maker as well as for add-on sales for an existing customer. Trading of Firepond's stock was halted after the news was released May 31. With revenue of $14.8M in the first six months of 2002, the falsified deals will drop revenue to $12.7M immediately, with Firepond planning to restate financial statements, including net loss figures in June. The bigger question is if this is just another sign of desperate times in the enterprise software market or the emergence of a broader trend of accounting scandals. For years, many large and small software vendors have had very loose accounting standards and questionable revenue recognition practices. This incident should act as a wake-up call for many vendors, and force them to understand their financial practices and what the CFO is doing to validate each contract that is signed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem comes as Firepond is working hard to gain momentum in targeted markets. To its credit, Firepond has already mobilized customer care teams to keep all customers informed of the specifics of the situation. Several Firepond users report positive experiences with the company and its products. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firepond needs to get past this distraction quickly, building a strong business case for its configuration and service software that quantifies increased order accuracy and the flow of real-time information. The cruel irony of this event is that configuration vendors stand to benefit first from an economic recovery, yet unethical business behavior like this employee's is delaying a true recovery. Like Xchange, Firepond would be wise to attempt to take the company private and return to being a small to midsize software vendor that deals in high-quality software and customer satisfaction, since life as a public company will never be the same.\n",

Today's environment rewards those vendors that exploit a vertical strategy.
